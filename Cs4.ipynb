    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

       " ['[crowd cheering] Thank you all for coming to the show tonight. I do appreciate it. In case you guys don’t know why I’m on tour right now, as of a couple of months ago, I’ve been doing stand-up comedy for 20 years. [audience cheers] Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My agent said to me, “Anthony, 20 years is a major accomplishment for any comedian.” “You gotta celebrate.” “Pick some of your favorite cities, go perform for them.” And I said, “No, thank you.” [audience chuckles] “I’d rather go to Milwaukee.” [audience laughs and applauds] But look… [audience chuckles] …I am excited to be here tonight. I’ve got great news. After 20 years of stand-up comedy, just last weekend, I finally perfected my act. [audience chuckles] Don’t get me wrong. I thought it was perfect before. [audience chuckles] Ran into an audience member after my show last Saturday who told me different. [audience chuckles] Last Saturday night, I’m doing a show in New York. After my set, I’m trying to get out to the car. A woman from the audience chases me down, practically tackles me. She says, “Anthony, that last joke you told tonight, your closer.” “I’ve gotta tell you, that joke is problematic.” “You need to think about it, and you need to change it.” So I changed it. And now it’s my opener. [audience laughs] [cheering and applauding] So, what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna tell you that joke. Explain what happened with that woman. And then nail home the point that I’m the best. [audience cheers and applauds] Now, as a comedian, I’ve got a responsibility. A responsibility that I take very seriously. The responsibility to get up in front of a group of strangers and give you my opinion on the trans community. [audience chuckles] Yeah. That’s right. [scattered cheering and applause] Look, guys. You’ve got to do it now. It’s in the handbook. Now, I feel… I feel like the trans community are the new pregnant women. [audience chuckles] Just in that… [clicks tongue] …it is never polite to guess. [audience laughs] Guys, you’ve got to trust me on this. You never… you never want to be like, “Hey.” “How far along are you?” [audience laughs] “Are you going to keep it or…?” No. [audience laughs] No, don’t do that. Even if you’re right, it’s rude. [audience chuckles] Do what I do. I’m smooth with it. I don’t ask the question. If I want to find something out, I just offer you a drink. “Here, have this glass of bourbon.” And if they say, “Actually, Anthony, I’m seven months pregnant,” then I get to be like, “Oh my God, you look amazing.” [audience laughs] But if they take the drink, they’re trans. [audience laughs] [scattered cheers] Now, obviously… obviously, that’s a closer. [audience chuckles] I could leave right now. It’d be fine. [audience chuckles] But this woman grabs me. Starts arguing with me. She says, “Anthony, I’ve gotta ask you, what is your intention with that trans joke?” I said, “Well, my intention is to make trans people laugh.” I mean, could you imagine? That would be historic. [audience laughs] And she says, “Well, Anthony…” “Anthony, you’re probably not even aware of this, but the problem with your joke is some trans people are insecure about the fact that they can’t have kids of their own.” “And your joke makes it sound like you’re saying the opposite of a pregnant woman is a trans woman, and',\n",
       "  ' that could be hurtful.” And I agree. [audience chuckles] That could be hurtful. But not coming from me. [clicks tongue] You see, I love trans people. I empathize with the trans community. I’m not trans myself. But I, too, am always getting yelled at for walking into the wrong bathroom. [audience laughs] I love trans people. You know what I hate? Pregnant women. [audience laughs and applauds] I mean, fuck those chubby bitches, am I right? They shouldn’t be allowed to play sports. [audience laughs] Now, look. Look, I will admit… I will admit that was a learning moment for me. Before that woman grabbed me, I didn’t know that trans people hated pregnant women as much as I do. [audience laughs] Makes me respect them all the more. So, just in case anyone here tonight is trans and you were offended by my first joke, here’s a joke I tailor wrote just for you to enjoy. Last week I saw a pregnant woman get hit by a bus. [audience chuckles] Or as I like to call it, a gender reveal party. [audience groans and laughs] [cheering and applause] What are you guys laughin’ at? That’s not for you. That’s just for my trans friends. Don’t like pregnant women. Don’t like kids. One of my friends just asked me if I would be the sperm donor for her baby. I said, “I don’t know. That’s a pretty big decision.” “How old is your baby?” [audience laughs] [cheers and applause] If you’re walkin’ in late, I hate kids. [audience chuckles] I hate them so much. It’s my whole thing. And what surprises me is now that I’m getting older, I’ve got friends, family members having kids of their own. And I don’t judge. Throw your life away. [audience chuckles] What surprises me is these people will text me pictures of their kids. “Anthony will want to see this. Send.” I never want to see that. [audience chuckles] The only time a kid shows up on my phone and I’m happy about it, Amber alert. Otherwise… [audience laughs] Otherwise, do not get my hopes up. [audience chuckles] I used to ignore those texts from my friends. Pretend I didn’t see ’em. Never respond. Then my sister had a kid. Started getting mad at me. She’d be like, “Really, Anthony? No response?” “You got nothing to say about this picture of your beautiful niece fucking up finger painting?” [audience chuckles] So I came up with a plan. Now, anytime, anytime anyone texts me a picture of their kids, I write back the exact same response. “Thanks.” [audience chuckles] “Gonna save this one for later.” [audience groans and laughs] Yup. No, that works. You guys can use that. It works. I haven’t heard from my sister in a year. It’s the best. Mm-hmm. Like a lot of people, I spent most of the pandemic stuck inside, starin’ at the walls, goin’ crazy. I started buyin’ weird shit online. Decided I was gonna redecorate my place. I don’t know anything about interior design. But I know what I like. So I went on eBay, and I paid $500 for a child’s coffin. [audience chuckles] I thought, “This’ll be great. It’s vintage.” [audience chuckles] You put that in your living room, it’s a conversation starter. You know? [audience laughs] But like so many of the things we bought online during the pandemic, I regret it now. Thing finally showed up in the mail. Empty. [audience chuckles] I know. I know. Look. Guys, guys, guys. I hate kids so goddamn much. [audience chuckles] I c',\n",
       "  'an’t talk to kids these days. The other day, my little nephew came up to me. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I’ve been getting bullied by another kid in school.” I said, “Don’t put up with that.” “Break his nose.” “He’ll leave you alone.” He said, “Uncle Anthony, that’s toxic masculinity.” [audience chuckles] Well, I wasn’t gonna put up with that. [audience laughs] Listen, you guys came out here to have a good time on a Saturday night. I know what you want. You want to talk politics. Let’s go. [audience chuckles] Let me tell you what’s wrong with this country. Let me tell you what the problem is with the United States of America. In this country, you’ve gotta be 16 years old to drive a car, right? That makes sense. But you’ve gotta be 18 years old to be considered an adult. To vote. I think that’s fucked up. I think if you’re old enough and mature enough to safely drive a car on the street, then I should be allowed to have sex with you. Right? [audience groans and laughs] Anyway… [audience chuckles] That’s the only problem with this country. [audience cheers] Now, as of this weekend, I’ve been on tour with this material for 18 months. And my favorite thing about touring around the country with these jokes the past 18 months has been telling that last joke in the South. [audience laughs] Guys, I have learned so much about this great country of ours. Right at the beginning of this tour, 18 months ago, I was doing a show in Alabama. Told them that joke. Guy in the audience stands up and says, “Anthony, I hate to break it to you, but the age of consent in Alabama is 16, so you gotta change that.” [audience chuckles] I said, “Oh, yeah?” You got to change that. And then a couple of weeks later, I did a show in Mississippi. Told them that joke then told them about Alabama. [audience chuckles] Guy in the audience stands up and says, “In Mississippi, the age of consent is 14.” And I said, “Ho-ly shit.” [audience laughs] That’s perfect. [audience laughs] I mean… That is what the Founding Fathers were all about. You know? I have a friend who works for the FBI. He pretends to be a 12-year-old girl. Goes on the Internet and chats with child molesters all day. I don’t know what he does for the FBI, but it’s gotta be… [audience laughs and applauds] I feel like the big new thing I keep hearing more and more about these days is porn addiction. I feel like every time I turn around, someone is complaining about their porn addiction. Not me. [audience chuckles] I can handle my shit. [audience laughs] But a couple of months ago, I’m at a family reunion. Big Jeselnik family reunion. Everyone is there. And the very first night, we’re all in this giant ballroom, eating dinner together as a family when my cousin stands up. He’s 15 years old. He says, “I have an announcement to make.” “I just want to tell you all that I’ve been suffering from a porn addiction.” “And it’s terrible.” “But I’m doing my best to get over it.” No one in my family knows what to say. Generations of Jeselniks are just staring straight ahead. Trying to eat their dinner. So I stood up. [audience chuckles] I said, “Hey, man.” “We can watch something else.” [audience laughs] “Look, I can put the game on if you want.” But when’s the next time we’re all gonna be together, you know? [clicks tongue] I don’t have a porn addiction.',\n",
       "  ' I watch a healthy amount of porn. [audience chuckles] I’ve got my favorites. Hell, I was in a bar the other night, saw my favorite porn star of all time sitting at the end of the bar by herself. I couldn’t believe it. I called the bartender over, “Man, I’ll have another beer.” “And see that girl down there?” “She shouldn’t be here. She’s 13.” [audience groans and laughs] Now, this is where audiences traditionally start to complain. [audience chuckles] They’ll say, “Anthony, why do you have so many jokes about abusing children?” “And why do you do them all in the beginning?” And this is where I kind of have to stop the show for a minute. And I explain to the audience the concept of gallows humor. Gallows humor is what I’m all about. Gallows humor is when you see something in the world that is so horrible that you have to laugh at it. Otherwise, it would destroy you. A couple of months ago, I’m reading the newspaper, and I come across an article about a priest in my hometown who just got arrested for molesting an altar boy at the exact same church where I was an altar boy growing up. That was horrifying to read. That could’ve been me. If I had become a priest. [audience laughs] [scattered applause] We like to have fun. [audience chuckles] I’m proud to say that I’ve never once in my entire life paid money to have sex with a prostitute. And I’ll tell you this. They get so mad. [audience laughs] You know, there’s one thing I like about Milwaukee. [clicks tongue] And there is one thing I like about Milwaukee. [audience chuckles] Seems like a safe place to live. Yeah. Maybe not to you, but compared to where I live in Los Angeles, oh my God, this is paradise. My neighborhood’s really gone to shit in the past couple years. Gotten dangerous. The other day, a woman in my neighborhood was walking her dog, had the dog stolen from her at gunpoint. Now it’s my dog. [audience laughs] I actually do love it here in Milwaukee. I enjoy any time I get to come and perform. One of the all-time great stand-up comedy towns, Milwaukee. Yeah. It cheers me up to be back in Milwaukee. I’ll tell you that. I’ve needed cheering up lately too. I’ve been a little down lately. I’ll admit it. Lost a friend recently. Stupid. Friend of mine went to the hospital for an elective surgery. A simple breast reduction surgery. Did not survive the surgery. Died right there on the operating table. As far as I’m concerned. [audience laughs] [audience cheers and applauds] Yeah. Somehow that’s become one of the most polarizing jokes I’m gonna tell all night. And if you didn’t laugh at it, that’s okay. But what the fuck do you know? [audience chuckles] I’ve been doing this for 20 years. [woman cheers] And I’ll be honest, I had no idea it had been 20 years before my agent told me. I never thought of 20 years as a goal I should be trying to achieve. I’ve never defined success by longevity. I’ve always defined success by how long has it been since I had to have a roommate. [audience chuckles] Yeah. It’s true. I haven’t had a roommate in 15 years. [woman cheers] I’m 45. That’s not a flex. [audience laughs] Last roommate I ever had… Last roommate I ever had, he had a video of every single person he’d ever had sex with in our apartment. Yeah. It’s a betrayal of trust. But it was hilarious. He had no idea. [audience lau',\n",
       "  'ghs] Another way I define success as an artist. How long has it been since I had to have a day job? Again, 15 years. I hated the day jobs I had to have coming up. Imagine what I was like at a day job 15 years ago. [audience chuckles] I had this one day job. Someone kept stealing my lunch. Someone stole my lunch every single day, even though I clearly had my name written on it. And I was pretty sure I knew who did it. I just couldn’t prove it. So, one day before work, I crushed up an entire bottle of laxatives. Enough laxatives to cripple a man. And I put them in my food, and then I waited until this guy got up to go to the bathroom. And as soon as he did, I shit all over his desk. [audience laughs] [clicks tongue] Yeah, I got fired from most of my day jobs. All of them, really. All of them except the last one. Last day job I ever had, I worked in a giant, soulless corporate office building, and I quit in the middle of the day after I watched a 60-year-old woman accidentally step into an empty elevator shaft and plummet 30 stories to her death. I just walked right the fuck out. And that was my last day in elevator repair. [audience laughs] If there’s one thing I’m getting sick of after 20 years of stand-up comedy, it’s the travel. I always say I do the shows for free. You pay me to travel. And that is certainly true tonight. [audience chuckles] Two nights ago, I fly from New York City to Milwaukee. Two-and-a-half-hour flight. It’s direct. It should be easy. I get on the plane. The woman sitting next to me has a 100-pound dog curled up in her lap. And I say, “Excuse me, but what the fuck is this?” [audience laughs] This woman, I swear to God, she rolls her eyes at me, and she goes, “Uh, this is my emotional support animal.” “I have a note from my doctor.” I was like, “Note from your doctor?” “Do you really need an emotional support animal on this flight?” And she goes, “No.” And I thought my head was going to explode. I don’t like when people take advantage of the system like that. It’s a two-and-a-half-hour flight. I talked to her about it. I’m happy to report by the time we landed, she needed that fucking dog. [audience laughs] Air travel has gotten so uncomfortable in the past few years. But everyone I know who flies a lot like I do, they always have a little trick. Everyone’s got their own unique trick to make flying easier for them. Like, I’m friends with a very wealthy married couple. They’re millionaires. And they got six kids in between the two of ’em. They’re always flying off on some exotic family vacation. And whenever they fly, their trick is the family flies on two separate airplanes. That way, worst-case scenario, one of those planes crashes, they don’t have to deal with their kids anymore. [audience laughs] Uh-huh. But look, if I’m being honest with you guys… If I’m being honest, I don’t actually have any married friends. [audience chuckles] I used to. Used to have a lot of married friends. But all my married friends have gotten divorced in the past two years. All of them. But I’ve noticed something. All my friends’ divorces, they all had two things in common. Infidelity and me. [audience laughs] Hey, listen. [clicks tongue] All right, listen. You guys have been great so far. I hate to do this to you, but this next joke is gonna be too smart for the c',\n",
       "  'rowd. Don’t worry. I will explain it to you. And after all, aren’t those the best jokes? Sigmund Freud’s mom must’ve been so fucking hot. [audience laughs] Okay? Get that? A lot of you were faking it for the cameras. Let me explain. Dr. Sigmund Freud. The most famous psychoanalyst of all time. His main theory, his main claim to fame, was the theory that every young man wanted to murder his own father and have sex with his own mother. Imagine. Imagine how hot his mom must have been for his colleagues to go, “Publish that.” [audience laughs] [clicks tongue] I was 14 years old when I walked in on my parents having sex. That’s a big moment for any young man. That moment when you realize your parents are more than just Mom and Dad. They’re also swingers. [audience laughs] Yeah, that was a core memory, for sure. Never forget that. I’ll never forget the night of my senior prom. Night of my senior prom. I’m 18 years old. I’m at home, putting on my tuxedo when my dad walked in the room, and he handed me a condom. Snuck it to me in a handshake. So fuckin’ gross. [audience chuckles] Then he looks me right in the eyes, and he says, “Anthony, do you have any questions?” I said, “Yeah, Dad.” Do you have one that’s still in the wrapper? [audience laughs] Yeah, my dad was fuckin’ weird, okay? All your dads are weird. When you’re a kid, you can’t recognize how weird your parents are. It’s not until you get older that you figure it out. Like, when I was a little kid, every year on my birthday, my dad would take me into the kitchen, put me up against the kitchen wall and make a little mark to measure my girth. [audience laughs] [Anthony] Mm. And maybe that messed me up a little bit. I don’t know. I feel like I’m a pretty normal guy. Although I do get angry when people try to talk to me about sex. I was having lunch with a friend the other day. And he says, “Anthony, I’ve been havin’ trouble with premature ejaculation.” I said, “Oh, yeah?” “Why don’t you try talkin’ about baseball?” [audience chuckles] He said, “Anthony, don’t you mean thinking about baseball?” And I said, “I don’t give a fuck what you think about.” “Just don’t talk to me about your premature ejaculation.” [audience cheers] When I was growin’ up, I had a sibling rivalry with my little brother. Got out of hand, to be quite honest. One day, my little brother went into the backyard, took my dog’s collar off, and let it run away from home. So I poisoned his fish. [audience chuckles] I think I won that one. ‘Cause the next day, I went out, and I found my dog, put his collar back on, brought him back home. But my brother, he died from the salmon. [audience laughs] Yeah, it’s a banger. [audience chuckles] Last year, my parents lost all of their money in a Ponzi scheme. So, of course, they came to me. Their wealthy, successful son. And asked me why I did that. [audience laughs] [Anthony] Mm. Mm. Yeah. My family didn’t have a lot of money when I was growin’ up. My dad was a volunteer firefighter. Do you know what a volunteer firefighter is? It is exactly like a regular firefighter. Except your son does not respect you. [audience chuckles] My mom’s been having a hard time. She’s gettin’ paranoid in her old age. Can’t sleep at night ’cause she gets too scared. So every night, around bedtime, she calls me to complain on the phon',\n",
       "  'e for hours that she’s too afraid to fall asleep in her own home. So finally, after months of this, just to get her off my back, I bought her a gun. And now she’s scared about that. She said, “Anthony, what’s the matter with you?” “Don’t you know that people who live with a gun are more than twice as likely to be shot in their own home?” I said, “Mom, I am counting on it.” [audience laughs and groans] And look, maybe, maybe I’m being too harsh. I have trouble sleeping sometimes too. Like the other night. The other night, I’m lying in bed, and I cannot fall asleep. I’m just staring out my bedroom window for hours. And I swear, I saw my next-door neighbor murder his wife in their kitchen then dispose of the body in garbage bags. Now I’m worried I’m next. Like, I don’t think he saw me, but he sure as shit heard me clappin’. [audience laughs] Now, here’s a joke I like a lot. My cousin Randy is maybe the dumbest person I’ve ever met in my entire life. Dumbest guy I’ve ever met. The other day, he comes up, and he goes, “Anthony, check out my new tattoo.” “It’s the Japanese symbol for awesome.” [clicks tongue] “No, Randy.” “That’s a swastika.” [audience laughs] “I mean, fuck, man. Everybody knows.” “Everybody knows that’s the German symbol for awesome.” [audience laughs and cheers] Now, I said I liked that joke a lot. Here’s how much I like that joke. I used to open with it. Right at the beginning of this tour, 18 months ago, Kanye West came to one of my shows. I had no idea he was even there. I didn’t find out until the next day when Kanye went on a podcast. And he said, “I went to go see Anthony Jeselnik last night, and his opening joke is so high level that it made me realize I’m not funny.” [audience chuckles] Guys, that blew my mind That’s the best compliment I’ve ever gotten in my life. I humbled Kanye West. [audience chuckles] You know. Yeah. I’m not gonna lie. I was so excited. I watched that clip 100 times. I sent it to my manager. I said, “Put this on my website.” “Put it on social media.” “Let’s sell some fucking tickets… [audience chuckles] …with a little help from Kanye.” And my manager says to me, “Anthony, are you out of your goddamn mind?” “Don’t you know what’s been going on with Kanye lately?” And I said no. Honestly. I used to be a huge Kanye fan, but I stopped paying attention to him when he went Christian. [audience chuckles] And my manager says, “Well, in the past two weeks alone, Kanye’s been wearing White Lives Matter T-shirts and saying wild, anti-Semitic shit.” And I was like, “Oh.” [clicks tongue] “He went super Christian.” [audience laughs] [audience cheers and applauds] That crazy son of a bitch finally finished the whole book. [audience laughs] My manager said, “Look, Anthony, you can use this clip of Kanye to promote yourself if you want to, but if you do, you gotta drop that swastika joke.” “You gotta stop doing it for sure.” “Otherwise, you’re gonna start to attract the wrong kinds of fans, and your current fans will take the wrong lesson from what you’re doing.” And that’s how much I like that joke. [audience laughs] I’m against cancel culture. [audience cheers] Thank you. That’s my impression of a shit comic trying to get on Rogan. [audience cheers] In 20 years of stand-up comedy, I’ve been asked the same questions over and over and ove',\n",
       "  \"r again. The question I get asked the most by far is, “Anthony, what do you think about cancel culture?” “Does it make you mad?” “Aren’t you scared? What do you think about cancel culture?” So, let me be clear. I don’t give a fuck about cancel culture. What I am sick of are comedians complaining about cancel culture. It’s not that hard. Do your job. [audience laughs and cheers] Comedians are supposed to be unparalleled badasses. I know this because I have a fucking mirror. [audience laughs] Cancel culture is not scary. It’s also not interesting. And it’s definitely not new. Back when I was in college, I had this crazy professor. Made all of his students fill out their own suicide note. Then he would read them out loud to the rest of the class. [audience chuckles] As soon as the parents found out, he got fired immediately. And I was the only one who stood up for him. Because, hey, he made math fun. [audience laughs] And yes, I did mention Joe Rogan, guys. Do not get me wrong. I like Joe. Joe’s my friend. Joe’s a good guy. But if you listen to his podcast, you’re a fucking loser. [audience laughs] My brother-in-law is Joe Rogan’s biggest fan. Never misses an episode. Doesn’t think four hours is long enough. But my brother-in-law is Joe Rogan’s target demographic. My brother-in-law is a conspiracy theorist. A crazy conspiracy theorist. Like, my brother-in-law refuses to become an organ donor because he swears that if you get into an accident and the paramedics see that you’re an organ donor, they won’t try to save your life ’cause they want to use your organs to help someone else. It’s insane, but I can’t argue with him. He’s a paramedic. [audience laughs] Another question I’ve been asked a million times in the last 20 years, “Anthony, what’s your favorite joke you’ve ever written?” It’s easy. The first one. Twenty years ago, when I started this, I started from nothing. I was nothing. I was just going around to open mics in Los Angeles, performing for bitter open-mic comedians who never reacted to anything. I was just trying to find my voice. Could I be good at this? Could I make it a living? And it took a while. Until one night, I went to a coffee shop, tried this joke out for the first time. Changed my whole life. I said, “Guys, my girlfriend loves to eat chocolate.” “She’s always eating chocolate, and she likes to joke she’s got a chocolate addiction.” Hmm? “‘Keep me away from those chocolate bars. I’m addicted to ’em.'” “And it’s really annoying.” “So one day I put her in the car, and I drove her downtown, and I pointed out a crack addict, and I said, ‘Do you see that, honey?'” “‘Why can’t you be that skinny?'” [audience laughs] And I will never forget telling that joke for the very first time to a room full of bitter open-mic comedians who never reacted to anything. And the whole room just went, “Ooh.” [audience chuckles] I was like, “Oh, I’m gonna be a fucking star.” [audience laughs] And then, of course, a couple years later, I got my big break, and I got to do some roasting. Got to roast Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen, Roseanne Barr, all the greats. [audience cheers] People still ask me, “Anthony, which one was your favorite?” Charlie Sheen. But not because of Charlie Sheen. I didn’t give a fuck about Charlie Sheen. I remember a couple days before that roast, I’\",\n",
       "  'm at home writing jokes. And I get a phone call from the network. And they say, “Anthony, I know you only have a couple days left to write, but we just added Mike Tyson to the dais.” “Will you be able to write yourself any jokes about Mike Tyson?” [audience chuckles] Two days later, I am walking into that roast with 100 jokes about Mike Tyson. [audience laughs] I am so excited. And right as I go to sit down, guy from the network comes back. He goes, “I’m just double-checking with you.” “You don’t have any Mike Tyson rape jokes, do you?” [audience chuckles] And I said, “Why?” [audience laughs] And he said, “Well, it was almost impossible to get Mike Tyson to agree to appear on a televised roast.” “We had to promise him there would be no rape jokes.” I was like, “Are we talking about the same Mike Tyson?” [audience laughs] So now the roast has begun. I’m up at the podium. Cameras are rolling. I have zero jokes about Mike Tyson. [audience laughs] And I am mad about it. But out of the corner of my eye, I can see Mike Tyson sitting on the stage. Mike’s been drinkin’. Mike’s been smokin’. Mike’s laughing at everything. Mike’s responding to jokes that aren’t even about him. Mike Tyson was having the time of his life. So I think, “You know what?” “I can do one.” [audience laughs] So I said, “I think Mike Tyson’s biggest problem is Mike never had a strong male role model growing up.” “Mike’s dad walked out on the family very early on after Mike raped him.” [audience laughs] [scattered applause] Now, as soon as I tell this joke… As soon as I tell this joke, I regret it. [audience chuckles] I am afraid. And I turned to look at Mike Tyson to see, is he coming at me? Am I about to die? And I just see Mike Tyson throw his head back, and he goes, [laughs] “He got you, Charlie.” [audience laughs] Guys, in 20 years of stand-up comedy, I’ve gotten to meet so many famous people. Haven’t given a fuck about any of ’em. Except for one, and that was Norm Macdonald. [audience cheers] Yeah. Yeah. All right. Long before I ever even considered becoming a comedian, I worshiped Norm Macdonald. He was my hero when I was a kid. He’s still my hero today. Never got to meet him for the longest time. Then a couple years ago, I get a phone call from my agent. He says, “Anthony, how would you like to be the new host of Last Comic Standing?” And I said, “Why the fuck would I want to do that?” [audience laughs] “That show sucks.” And he said, “This year, it’s gonna be different.” “This year, they have Norm Macdonald as a judge.” “Would you like to work with Norm?” And I signed up on the spot. Norm and I made eight episodes of this TV show together. Eight straight nights of eight-hour tapings every night. And for the first four episodes, Norm Macdonald and I do not get along at all. [audience chuckles] We get into fights every night on the air. We get into fights every night backstage. We flat-out do not like each other. And it’s killing me. He’s my hero and the only reason I took this job. So for those first four episodes, I am working at it, and I’m working at it hard. Norm’s working at it too, just not nearly as hard. [audience chuckles] But after four episodes, for whatever reason, something clicks. Finally, Norm and I are laughing together. We’re getting along. All I ever wanted. After the show was',\n",
       "  ' finally finished, Norm and I had to go and promote it. And the last time I ever saw Norm Macdonald, we are backstage at Larry King. I’m getting interviewed first, and then Norm. Right before I go out, Norm says to me, “Hey, Anthony, I know we haven’t always gotten along or seen eye-to-eye, but if you’re up for it and you trust me, I thought of something really funny that you and I could do together.” I said, “Oh my God, Norm. Of course. You’re my hero.” “Tell me what you want to do.” He says, “I think it’ll be funny if instead of promoting the show by talking about these other comedians, why don’t you and I just promote the show by publicly insulting each other?” He says, “Don’t even try to be funny, Anthony.” “Just be mean.” [audience chuckles] And I said, “You know what, Norm? I can do that.” [audience laughs] I sit down with Larry King. Larry says, “Anthony, what you think about Norm Macdonald?” And I said, “Larry, Norm Macdonald is a piece of shit.” [audience chuckles] And I can hear Norm laughing backstage. I finish the interview. I go backstage. Norm is still laughin’. He says, “Anthony, that was perfect.” “Now, watch this.” [audience chuckles] Norm sits down with Larry King. Larry King says, “Norm, what do you think about Anthony Jeselnik?” Norm says, “Larry, he’s one of the greats.” [audience laughs] [audience applauds and cheers] I’ve never been more pissed off in my entire life. [audience chuckles] Can’t believe I fell for that. You have been an amazing crowd today. I’m going to leave you all with this. This is my new closer. Don’t worry. It is trans-proof. [audience chuckles] About a month ago, I went to a wedding. Craziest wedding I’ve ever seen. After the ceremony, every single person there took Molly. The bride took Molly. The groom took Molly. The parents, the grandparents. Every single person there was on Molly. Craziest shit I’ve ever seen. I blacked out around midnight. Woke up the next morning in a fucking hammock somewhere. Went and found the bride and groom, and I was like, “Hey, guys.” “Did I do anything embarrassing last night?” And they said, “Yeah, Anthony.” “You spiked the punch with Molly.” [audience laughs] Thank you very much, Milwaukee. Have a great night. Thank you. [audience cheering and applauding] [indistinct, excited chatter] [chatter fades] Your email address will not be published.

This self-produced show reflects Rife’s intimate connection with his audience, evidenced by his first YouTube-released special, “Only Fans.” Rife’s humor traverses a wide range of topics, including his personal life, societal observations, and playful yet edgy commentary on relationships, identity, and sexuality. A recurring theme is his humorous appreciation for gay men, along with a tongue-in-cheek lament about his straight identity. He shares anecdotes about his family, notably a comically risqué story involving his grandfather and unconventional Christmas gifts, which elicits both shock and laughter from the audience. Rife doesn’t shy away from addressing potentially contentious issues like dating, red flags in relationships, and the intricacies of navigating modern sexual dynamics. His commentary extends to broader societal topics, including political correctness, cancel culture, and the complexities of identity politics, all delivered with his characteristic irreverence. Rife balances his edgier material with self-awareness and a clear intention not to cause harm, instead aiming to find humor in life’s absurdities. The special culminates in a poignant tribute to his late grandfather, revealing a tender and heartfelt dimension to Rife’s persona.

Let’s see who gets offended. [Music] [Applause] Thank you! Oh, my God, Austin, what the fuck is up? How is everybody? Good? Let’s go! Oh, my God, thank you guys so much for coming out. This is so cool. It means the absolute world. Thank you, guys. Ah, just checking you all out. This is fun. This is good. Gay? One for one, baby. Let’s go, let’s go! Oh, it’s the energy I was looking for. Thank goodness, man. Oh, my God, thank you so much for coming out twice. I appreciate that. It’s very brave, very great. I’ll be honest with you, I wish my entire crowd was gay, man, to be honest. It’s just an energy you want to be around, you know what I mean? I’ve never met a gay dude in a bad mood, not once. I’ve been so jealous of gay men lately. You have no idea. That’s what I’m talking about, man. I’ve been so jealous, man. It looks like a good time going on over there. I wish I was gay, for the fitness or the fashion alone. Are you kidding me? Oh, my God, I’m straight, but I’d love to be in gay shape, you know what I mean? You ever meet a gay dude? They’re in great shape, every fucking time, man. It’s so impressive. Gay dudes stay in the gym. That’s the guy’s name, Jim. They just stay in there. They’re just turning it out, burning calories, dog. It’s dedication. You better respect it. That’s next-level fitness, bro. That’s that level of in shape, like, you could fight off another grown man if you wanted to. You know, that’s up to you. You put in the work. Top or bottom, that’s you, dog. That’s your prerogative. God, if they’re not fucking shredded, they fucking dress impeccably. You guys look fantastic. Oh, my God. I don’t know if you guys know this, but gay men have a stranglehold on the fashion game. They are killing shit bro. Nobody in this world dresses better than gay men. You better respect it. It’s pretty impressive. I mean, you spend enough time in the closet, you’re bound to find something, you know. He goes… boots! Love it. Oh, man. Exhausted, man. We’ve been traveling a lot this year. It’s been very exciting. It’s one of the most fun parts about the job. Obviously, it’s a little taxing as well. I got a chance to go home recently. I’m originally from Ohio. I don’t know if anybody’s ever made that mistake. I never go home. I left 10 years ago, after high school, and that’s about it, man. I go home maybe once or twice a year. I’ll go home for Christmas or something like that, you know. I’ll go home for the holidays. I don’t mind that as much because whenever I go home for Christmas, I stay with my grandpa, and I love my grandpa to death. He’s probably the closest person to me in my family. And I love staying with him because whenever I’m not there, he lives by himself. My grandpa has lived alone for like 15 years. It’s been single 15 years. Hasn’t been on a date in 15 years. As you can imagine, carpal tunnel is on its way. And because he’s lived alone for so long, he’s kind of become this crotchety, grumpy old man. He doesn’t like anything or anybody. He complains all day long. You all know an old person like this. He’s alw',\n",
       "  'ays the hardest person to shop for, for Christmas, every year. So, two years ago, it’s mid-December, right? I’m at my place in L.A., I’m getting ready to go home, you know, finishing up all my online shopping. And it gets down to him. Every year, I’m sitting there, just racking my brain, I’m like, “What the fuck do I get this dude?” He doesn’t like anything. He doesn’t like anybody. He doesn’t have anybody. So, I bought him a pocket pussy. Normally, I would be like, “Does anybody not know what a pocket pussy is?” But this is Sixth Street; y’all be fucking banana peels, whatever y’all can find out here. Y’all in no position to judge my family, okay? Bro, I just wish y’all could have been there to see him open it on Christmas morning because we all thought he was gonna be like, “What the fuck is this shit?” He was like, “Thank you.” This is exactly what I needed.” I was like, “It’s a flashlight, not a Purple Heart, dog. Relax, okay? Stop feeling so honored.” He loved it, man. So obviously, Christmas is a good time. And then we fast forward a little bit. Now, we fast forward to that following February, and I hadn’t spoken to my grandpa since Christmas. So, I call him up. “Steve, Stephen, what’s up, man? How you doing? I love you. I miss you. My Christmas was fun. It’s always good to spend the holidays with you, you know. How was it?” And there was just a silence on his end of the phone. I was like, “Are you using it right now? Like, fucking answer me, dog. Like, what’s the review, you know? I’m interested.” He gets all defensive, and I’ll never forget these words for as long as I live. He goes, “No, no, no, no, no. I, uh, I broke her neck.” There is so much to unpack in that one sentence. First of all, “her”? You gave it a pronoun; now it’s real. Second, “neck”? That’s not even what it is. And third, you broke it, dog? How hard are you going? Fucking 15 years, you forget how to be a gentleman? So, we laughed on the phone for a couple of hours, and then now we fast forward to the following Christmas. This is last Christmas. Again, same time of year, going home, finishing up shopping, gets down to him. So now, I’m really struggling. I’m like, “What the fuck do I get this dude this year?” Like, how do I possibly top what I did last year, you know? Clearly, he enjoyed it, and now my man hasn’t had pussy since at least February. So, uh, I doubled down. Got him another one. I got him two pocket pussies, two Christmases in a row. I’m grandson of the decade, easily. Only, well, you know, obviously, I was a little bit more aware of what it was going to be put through this time around. I had to find it more and more durable, right? You know, something with a stronger neck. Now, I’m out here trying to find a pocket pussy with traps, trying to find my Papaw a trap queen for Christmas. And I– fuck… I couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for. I was so mad. And then, I think I found the next best thing. I found this other pocket pussy that I’ve never seen anything like it. It was remarkable. It came with– it was like so souped up, it came with all these, like attachments and pieces… It was like a Swiss Army pussy. It had a compass, a can opener, and it doubles as a canteen if you’re lost in the woods, I guess. But by far, the best attachment this thing came with was that, like, if you… if you… like, let’s say… you fucked this side of it, right? Like, this is the entrance. This side of it is a suction cup. The idea being, you can fucking put it on walls and shit, if you need to. I don’t know, switch positions, work your legs, you know, whatever it is, feel like you need it added to your repertoire, you know? And I got it for him, thinking like, “Yo, this is so creative.” You know, now my man’s got free roam in the house. You know, he’s not bed-bound, beating his dick like a pilgrim. He’s got options, you know what I mean? So, I was excited for him. But now, I’m fucking terrified to go home this Christmas, and there’s just gonna be chunks of drywall missing all around the house, waist level. “Doing a bit of remodeling, are we?” His house looks like a mid-demo project. Like, “Ah damn, Papaw, you literally fucked from the window to the wall.” [Applause] So, dick sucked down the hall. Oh, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve. He’s disgusting… but he’s funny, man. He’s very funny. I called him about a month ago, and I told him I was gonna start telling this story on stage because it’s 100% true. And I think the world should know that. And he’s got such a good sense of humor, man. He was joking with me back. He was like, “You keep telling people that story, I’m gonna leave it to you in my will.” Which I think would be fucking hilarious. I told him, “Yo, you should do that, because I’ll fucking, I’ll put your ashes in it, name it Ashley, and then I’ll fuck it. Just kind of keep it in the family, you know what I mean?” Just from generation to generation, just so he can meet his great-grandkids, you know. Just, guys, it’s called cremation, grow up, okay? Grow up. [Applause] It’s not your grandpa, and my grandpa’s funny, man. You guys would like him. You can judge them if you want to. At least he got somebody. It’s hard. It’s hard to find your person, isn’t it? Dating’s hard. It’s a very cliche topic. Every comedian talks about how hard dating is, but yeah, it’s a relatable subject. Something everybody goes through. You know, it definitely',\n",
       "  ' gets harder depending on where you live. Like I said, I live in L.A. now. It’s the fucking worst, bro. There are no good people. Bunch of fucking heathens running around. Nobody’s going to heaven. Not one person. City of Angels? No angels. It’s depressing, man. It’s so depressing, getting let down every time. Like, I just expect it at this point. Every first date I go on, as soon as I sit down, I’m like, “Alright, bitch, what is it? Ask me what my sign is. I dare you. I’ll split this check so fucking fast. I swear to God. Oh, you’re a Pisces? Awesome. Yeah, charge it to her crystals. They were in the moon all night last night. Clearly, that should stop.” I’m so fucking tired of hearing about astrology. I swear to God. It’s all y’all care about. I’ve stopped sending dick pics and just started sending my star chart, to be honest. It’s getting me so much further. So much further. [Applause] I hate it so much, man. I have so many red flags now, bro, and no patience. That’s the main thing. It’s like, I’ve been let down so many times. Like now, if I see something that triggers a red flag in me, I’m gone. I’m not gonna wait around to be inevitably let down, you know what I mean? It’s a waste of time. And I’ve got so many red flags. So, there are some that I want to get off my chest, and I think maybe we’ll find some common ground. Maybe you’ll think I’m crazy, but I think it’s worth finding out. And we’ll start slow. We’ll ease our way into it. We’re gonna start with red flag number one. And just a disclaimer, this one is not going to be the funniest one, but I do think it’s going to resonate with the most amount of people here. Red flag number one is when she had… that… That [ __ ] is red flag number one. Girls who don’t drink enough water, that’s what it is. Red flag number one is when she has another guy in her life who is consistently trying to sleep with her, and she refuses to acknowledge this. This is good. It’s gonna cause a lot of fights in the car ride home. It’s my favorite one. You clapping, you had a… you had an argument recently… Like I said, this isn’t the funniest one, but every dude in here in a relationship right now knows the guy in his girl’s life that he’s like, “fuck that dude. I’ll kill him tomorrow.” It’s so obvious to us, right? As the boyfriend, that shit is clear as day. We can spot it from a mile away. Usually, at the beginning of the relationship, we’ll clock it. We’ll pull you aside. “Hey, babe, I know you hang out with so-and-so, and that’s fine. You’re a grown woman. You can do whatever you want. I’m not controlling or anything. But just so you know, that dude’s trying to fuck you.” And women will always have the exact same naive reaction. “Babe, come on. Are you serious? Him? You’re worried about him? He’s literally like my best friend. Like, he’s literally like a brother to me.” “Word? Oh, that’s your brother? Oh, I didn’t realize what kind of PornHub family tree you were associated with, but shut it down, okay? He’s not your friend. He’s not your brother. He wants to enter your body holes. End of story. Okay?” Ladies, you have to understand. The reason we are so passionate about bringing this to your attention is not because we think you’re stupid. It’s not because we don’t trust you. It’s that you’re being taken advantage of. You’re hanging out with somebody who’s lying about their intentions so they can weasel their way into your life. That’s not a real friend. That’s some shady shit to do. So, we’re just trying to point out something that’s happening under your nose, so hopefully, you can be aware of it and put a stop to it. I promise you, we are coming at it with good intentions. And you still want to get mad at us and act like we’re the crazy ones making this shit up. “Oh, that is so ridiculous. Why would a guy go through all that trouble and pretend to be my friend just to sleep with me?” Okay, I don’t know, but I’ve done it so many times. How do you think I got you, stupid? Come on. Oh, my God, knuckle buddy! No, nobody has been a better friend than me. Are you kidding me? That’s why dudes can spot the shit ’cause fucking game recognizes game, you know what I mean? He’ll do some shady shit and we’re like, “fucking, good move. That’s what shit I would have done. You know, fuck you, but respect.” He is not your friend, ladies. And if you really do treat him like your best friend, oh, that’s so much worse because if you treat him like your best friend, that means you’ve gone to him with all of your secrets, all of your problems. He knows everything you like, everything you don’t like. You’ve probably complained to him about everything your boyfriend does wrong. So now, this motherfucker has all the Infinity Stones to become the perfect guy for him. So, when you and your boyfriend finally break up, who do you go running to? Me. And I’ve been waiting for this moment, boy, weeks, months, maybe years. I’ve been waiting for this exact opportunity, bro. I’ve been putting in work, too. I’ve been sending you memes in the morning. I’ve been texting you, “How’s your day going?” I don’t give a fuck about your day. Are you stupid? It’s about my day. I care about my day. Come on, man. It’s about patience. All I’ve had to do is play it cool and stay in the game long enough, and wait for the day that you come banging on my door, crying your eyes out. And I just have to play stupid, like,',\n",
       "  ' “Whoa, whoa, wait, why are you crying? He says he doesn’t trust me? It’s crazy. Y’all broke up? Oh my God, I am so sorry. Oh, some dudes are so insecure. Oh my God.” He’s not your fucking friend. Stop falling for his shit, ladies, I’m trying to tell you. Oh my God! Shut up. [Applause] Now, I understand this is the part of the red flag that I’m sure a lot of the women in the audience are thinking, “Well, Matt, what about the reverse? How about when a guy has a girlfriend? What about that?” And I hear you. Look, ladies, you can be – look, a guy can have a girl that is just a friend. No, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. I’ll wait. You, as a girl, can be just a friend to a guy, but it means you’re ugly. I’m sorry, I know you don’t want to hear it, but you are just a homie with a ponytail. I don’t know what else to tell you, man. Men and women can be just friends, but one of y’all fucking busted. Okay? Somebody’s ugly. Or maybe both of you are ugly. In which case you should be fucking anyways. That’s why it’s called bumping uglies. Like I said, it’s not the funniest one, but you got some thinking to do. Red flag number two: She cannot have any distinct physical features. I’ll explain. Nobody feel targeted. And before you get mad at me, I’m not even the shallow one in this red flag, by the way. It’s my fucking friends, because all of my friends are Black, and they will roast you within an inch of your life if you have anything prominent about your face that stands out at all. They have cost me so many potential relationships. I was seeing this girl last summer. I thought maybe she was the one, man. She was fucking beautiful. She was smart, funny, didn’t know her dad. She was new to town. She had just moved to L.A. from Austin a couple of months before I met her. Like, very, very sweet, innocent girl, right? We were hanging out for a while. We went on a handful of dates, and everything was going great. Until, just a couple of dates in, I was hanging out with a bunch of my friends of mine who I hadn’t seen in a while. So, you know, we’re hanging out, catching up, and they’re grilling me about, you know, what’s going on, what’s new, you seeing anybody? And I was so proud and excited to be seeing this new girl. So, you know, I broke out her Instagram. I was like, “That’s her.” And my friends immediately were like, “Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Which is Black for, “I’m about to hurt your feelings, bro.” They roasted this poor girl for, like, 90 minutes. Did I laugh? Yeah, but fuck those dudes. I’m not gonna stop hanging out with her over it, you know? I didn’t. We kept hanging out. We went on a few more dates until our last date, man. We were at dinner, and she just laid it out there. She was like, “You know what, Matt? I’m having a really nice time with you, and I think it’s time we take this relationship to the next level. And we need to start incorporating our friends into our hangouts, you know? I need to meet your friends. You need to meet my friends. We’ll all hang out together, see if our friend groups get along, you know?” And I was like, “Uh, why? You know, why are you trying to rush things? You know, I’m having such a good time getting to know you.” She’s like, “No, it’s important that our friends get along.” And I was like, “No, I hear you. I just don’t… I don’t think it’s such a good idea.” And she started to get really upset. She was like, “And why not?” And I was like, “Because we have the same chin.” She was like, “What?” I was like, “You have like a cleft chin. Like how I have. It’s very strong. It’s a very masculine facial feature. And like, I think it’s cute, obviously, but not everybody does.” She was like, “What are you trying to say?” I was like, “My friends are going to roast you. They’re gonna make fun of the way you look. I’m sorry. It’s just how they are.” “Oh, that is so childish. Like, what are they gonna say? That I have like a butt chin? Ooh, so original. Like, I’ve heard it all before, babe.” “And I was like, ‘Nooo, you haven’t.’ I don’t know how many Black friends you have, but this is kind of what they do. Okay? Do you know that they call you the Texas Chinsaw Massacre? Did you know that?” That was just off the top. She was so offended. “Oh, that is so rude. Is that all they know about me, is what I look like?” I was like, “No, they know you just moved here from Texas to be a chinfluencer, they said?” And now I miss her, man… I know. She was my little Chinderella… So stupid. I appreciate you wearing your best shorts. I know it’s hot outside. Like, this is still an event, you know what I mean? He’s like, “I know, I’m going to a comedy show, but just in case there’s a trampoline.” Didn’t even try. You mowing the grass after this? God damn, man. Whatever, it’s not your night. You’re right. Pressure’s on me. Red flag number three. Yeah, there’s more. Red flag number three: A big red flag for me is if I don’t have anything in common, like hobby-wise, with somebody. Like, it’s such a necessary relationship trait to have. I think it’s so easy to be physically attracted to somebody, obviously. It’s everyone’s first instinct. But I think if you want longevity in a relationship, you have to have that extra layer of compatibility, right? You have to want to do things together. I think, like, a big red flag for me is if a girl doesn’t go to the gym. And that’s just because it’s a very big part of my',\n",
       "  ' life. I love going. I go every day. I’m a very big advocate of going to the gym and working out. And it’s so good for your health, not just your physical but your mental health as well. Get your endorphins going, get some of that stress relief out of you, you know. But I do acknowledge that it’s not for everybody. It’s intimidating for some people who don’t go every day, and I try to be cognizant of that and try to help out the best I can. Like, there may be some people in here right now, or maybe watching at home, that want to get started and just don’t know how to take that first step. And if there is anybody out there, I highly recommend the program I just started about six months ago that changed my life forever. And that program is where I only work out with Black dudes exclusively. Because Black dudes will push you to your limits, whether you want to or not. I started about six months ago, man. I was in the gym one day, I was having a bad day, I was stressed about something, I was angry about something. And I was like, “Man, fuck this. I’m gonna use this negative as a positive. I’m gonna use this aggression, I’m gonna put up some weight.” And I’ll say it was chest day, so I was like, “fuck it, I’m gonna hit a new max on the bench press.” So I go in there, put the lighter weights on first, get loosened up, get warm, you know, then you gotta put on the heavier stuff. And when you do that, you’re supposed to have a, um, a spotter, so you don’t die. And I didn’t know anybody in there at the time. Closest person to me was this Black dude next to me. So I walked over, I was like, “Hey man, would you mind spotting me for this set real quick?” And he was like, “Yeah, I got you.” I was like, “I feel like you do. Everything about your voice is safe. I feel like I can lift the world now. Okay, come on.” So we go over to the bench together. He gets behind the rack in the spot position. He’s ready. I lay down, and I’m trying to psych myself up, get in the zone, line up my hands, get a good grip. And finally, I just get it off the rack. I get one rep in. Oh! I get two reps in. I hit a third, my arms start shaking, and he can see this. So like any good spotter, he has some words of encouragement. I’m trying not to die, and this man just gets in my ear. “Do that shit! Do that shit! You ain’t nothing!” I was like, “I don’t know, man. I’m getting kind of tired.” He was like, “My people been tired.” I was like, “God damn, I’m sooorry.” It was only like 255, you had white guilt on top, that’s like 500 pounds, man. I was like, “Is this pre-workout or a history lesson? What are we doing, dog?” I racked that shit up. I was like, “I appreciate you, man. I was struggling at the end.” He was like, “You don’t know struggle.” Fuck man, can’t have anything. So, that’s my new routine. Whenever somebody’s like, “You look good, Matt. You on a diet?” I’m like, “Yeah, it’s called White Watchers. You should try it. It’s when black people watch white people struggle. You will sweat, I promise you.” This is one of the whitest crowds I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Bro, I’m uncomfortable. You know, there’s so… Is this a comedy show or a meeting? God Damn! Oh my gosh. I’m sorry. Um, we could try something different. This could be fun, or it could be a fucking nightmare, but I think we can have fun. Um, so the thing is, it’s like, I could do red flags for hours, right? And they can be funny. We could all laugh, have a guaranteed good time, but who wants to do that? So, and a lot of times, I don’t like to do a lot of red flags because it is very male to female, you know? It’s listing things that men don’t like about women, and I don’t want that to be unfair, one-sided, or sexist. So, to even it out, sometimes I am genuinely curious. Like, for the women in the audience, what might be some red flags for a guy if you go on a date with them? He says or does this, that makes you kind of be like, “Oh, I don’t know.” I’m gonna go balcony. I’m gonna go balcony. What is it? Is it a good one? Splitting the check? Okay, splitting the check. Um, on a first date? He asked in the beginning of the date? Towards the middle? Oh, you were boring. In the middle? “Can I get you anything?” “Yeah, two checks. Two checks would be alright. Yeah, yeah.” So, where did you say you were from? How recently was this? Five months ago? Okay, and you’re still upset… Um, so hold on, where did you go to eat? What is it? The Gin and Temple? What is that? [Applause] Rude. What kind of restaurant is that? Yeah, yeah, catfish and steak. [Music] It’s like a Roadhouse, an expensive Roadhouse. Okay, well, yeah, I mean, maybe did you like him until that moment? Did you like him? [Applause] I’m curious. Until he asked to split the check, were you like, “This is going good?” You were… Fuck. Did you sleep with him? Wow. Oh my God. He split you and the check in one night! [Applause] Oh my God. [Applause] Did he leave a big tip? That was an unnecessary detail. Would did you say? He was sweaty after? Yeah, my man was putting in work. That’s just… That’s good… I think. Well, I’m sorry you got half of a meal. All right, well, one for one. What’s another fun one? \\xa0Do you have a fun one? What is it? This is going to get cancelable. Let’s do it. So, you said it when he says he’s on hormone therapy, but he’s just fucking jacked. So, hormone therapy, what’s that supposed to do? Balance it ou',\n",
       "  't, basically? So, what he says, he has too much like natural testosterone. He doesn’t have enough. Okay. How long have you been seeing this man? 25 years. [Applause] What? Where’d you meet him? You met him when you were kids. So, he tells you he’s going on hormone therapy to get more testosterone, but you think he’s on steroids, you know? So, did you find them? Could you get me some? Thank you. I’m trying to get in gay shape, dog. Let’s go. I’m taking all the shortcuts. You did find some. Was it a needle or a pill? [Applause] She said she thinks he is in gay shape. The plot thickens. Oh my God, this is the bigger red flag now. He has his workout buddies. Do you have a picture of him? I want to see what his gaydar says about… Oh, God damn it. The phones are locked up. God damn, your phone isn’t a hormone blocker. God damn it. Okay, after the show, I want to see this. Yeah, that’s a valid red flag. You don’t want somebody who’s lying about an obvious appearance thing. Like, if you’re clearly on steroids, just open up, it’s fine. It’s fine to do it, if that’s the body you want and the life you want to live. You chicken fucking can do that. It’s fine, as long as you can still get your dick up, you’re fine. If you can’t, then it’s not okay. Stop what you’re doing immediately. Okay… Let’s unlock her phone. Can we unlock her phone? [Applause] Okay, okay, okay, okay. Bro, what if it’s just a picture of me? Oh my God, that’s it. That’s what you unlock them with, that fucking flying saucer. Can I see your phone? There we go, pass it over. Oh, this is great. This better be worth it. There we go, pass that back, there we go. I just gotta see a picture of this guy, and then I want to see what you think. I want to test this gaydar. Let’s go. Ah, damn bro. He had the traps that my grandpa’s pocket wishes it had. [Applause] Why is his neck so big? Oh my God, this looks so unsure. Okay, resident gay, what are we thinking? What are we thinking? What is it? The pose? He’s gay? Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Any excuse to drink, go ahead! [Applause] Let’s go. Whenever we out again an angel gets his wings. This is good, this is good, everybody knows that. Okay, two for two, good about to see. All right, that was good. We’re gonna do one more for an even three. I don’t know if you can top that, but what’s a more fun one? College baseball? Oh man, you’ve been fingered in a dorm for sure. Okay, good. Oh, okay, all righty, let’s dive into this. All right, all right. So, who went pro and didn’t take you with him? Who was it? [Applause] All right, what is it that you don’t like about college baseball players? The ego of playing a collegiate sport at a high level? You can’t be proud about that? The seventh pitcher on the team? I love how you’re clowning them for that, but Loki you fucked with the seventh pitcher on the scene… Your pussy is the ball pen, do you know that? Strike one. Is it just an ego thing? That’s the only thing you don’t like about it? Because he could just be proud to be playing a sport. I loved playing high school sports. I didn’t get to play at a college level, but I would have been very excited to. Oh, you never… You never fucked him? Damn, you couldn’t even fuck the seventh pitcher on the baseball team? Damn, strike two! Oh my gosh, where did you go to school? You didn’t go to school? You didn’t go to college? Strike three, bitch! [Applause] Oh my God, that could not have gone better. I could not have gone better. Oh my God. Have you tried Little League? For the Love of the Game. Come on, guys. Okay, well that was fun. It’s a fun portion. No more crowd work. Nobody else yell out anything. That chapter is done. That’s fun, that’s fun. I like doing that portion of the show because it’s like, obviously, I come out here, I list all these red flags and their standards that I’ve set for myself. But it’s nice to know where other people draw the line. You know, what are some other people’s red flags? Is it something that could apply to me? There’s a lot of self-reflecting that I think people need to do more often, especially when you’re single. If you’re single, use that time to do some self-reflection. Think about the kind of shit you like. I went through a horrible breakup at the beginning of this last year, and I thought it was such a low moment. I was like, this is such a lull in my life, nothing positive is going to come out of this. But I did some thinking, and it made me realize so much about myself, made me think about the standards I wanted to set. But it also made me think about how much I fucking hate being single. This shit is so trash. It’s so trash. People over-hype the fuck out of being single, don’t they? Especially the freedom aspect of it. As soon as you’re single again, all your friends are like, “Oh, you can go sleep with whoever you want.” No, you can’t. No, you couldn’t before. Why could you now all of a sudden? The factor of being single, to me, I don’t like. I don’t like sleeping with a bunch of different people anyways, because I don’t like… That’s not fun. [Applause] That’s not fun, man. I don’t… I don’t like inconsistent feedback. My ego can’t handle it, dog. I’m too fickle. Okay, I need to know where I stand sexually at all times. Okay, that’s the best part of any long-term relationship. If you’ve been together long enough, you probably have pretty good sexual chemistry. That’s w',\n",
       "  'hy you stuck around. You like what they like, they like what you like, messes pretty well. The relationship that I ended earlier this year, that was the best part about it. We stayed together months after we should have, just because we had that sexual chemistry. It’s a hard spark to walk away from. It’s fun, makes you feel good about yourself, you know. I was getting my ego stroked daily. Like, how the fuck do you walk away from that? It’s so much fun. I knew with this girl, there was like a certain position I could put her in, and if I hit her with like the right move, just bow, then like, she couldn’t handle that. Like, it was too much dick for her. She was like, “Oh, my stomach.” And I’m like, “Shut up. It is not in your stomach with your shallow guts. Whatever.” I should call her. Don’t call the ex, don’t do it. Don’t fall for it because sexual chemistry will make you ignore all the other red flags, the… you should be paying attention to. Like my ex and I, we had great sexual chemistry, but our communication was… terrible. We could never talk anything out. If there was ever a point that I needed to get across to her, I would just have to like finger her in Morse code. The next day, my boys are like, “How’d the talk go?” I’m like, “It was terrible. This… just sat back and rolled her eyes at me the whole time.” Luckily, I can read lips. [Applause] Hate it. But you know, single again, back to the streets. Now I just gotta have sex with all these women I don’t want to do. I don’t want to do it. I’d rather be in a relationship personally, but somebody had fucking other plans. And I want y’all to think about that the next time you’re about to chastise a dude for being a fuck boy. Like, “Oh, you just a… boy, you out here sleeping with all these girls, you don’t even want to be in a relationship, you’re just a fuck boy.” Maybe he’s not a fuck boy, maybe he’s sad. Maybe behind every fuck boy is a man who once loved too much. Okay, or maybe that’s exactly what a fuck boy would say. TBD. But while I’m single, I’m trying to use this time to be self-reflective, work on myself, think about what are some of the red flags I bring to the table. Is there something I could be working on? And a major one, a major red flag for me that’s been brought to my attention that I didn’t realize was as big of a deal as it is, and it’s, you know, in relation to the climate we live in today, and that red flag is that apparently, I’m not very PC. I’m not very politically correct. So, I don’t know if that term made it down here yet or not. Y’all, y’all don’t seem to give a fuck. So, and when I say that, I just mean like, I’m not one of those people who tries so fucking hard to like prove how woke, what a good person I am, because that shit comes across as so disingenuous and corny to me. Like, you’re clearly pandering so hard. You can be a good person without it being your entire fucking personality, you know what I mean? So exhausting, man. As long as, as long as you know your heart’s in the right place, you’re doing the best that you can, you don’t need to prove yourself on Twitter every fucking day. And obviously, I’m referencing the extremes, these like woke internet warriors or whatever you want to call these fucking losers, who spend their whole life trying to cancel people on the internet. That shit pisses me off so much because they’re ruining, they’re ruining a good agenda. Cancel culture is not necessarily a bad thing. I get what they’re trying to do, is eradicate negativity in the world and get rid of some bad, toxic shit, and we do need that. But a lot of that gets lost in translation when they carry it out because they themselves are such bitches dog. Oh my God, bro. And that drives me insane because I’m, I’m on their side. I hate the same shit they hate. Off the top of my mind, I can think of, um, homophobia. Homophobia is a massive pet peeve of mine because it doesn’t fucking affect you, who somebody else loves has nothing to do with you. And oh, and it is always the ugliest fucking dude who’s the most homophobic, isn’t it? The most toothless motherfucker from Corpus Christi. [Applause] “I’m, I’m not with that gay shit.” They’re not with you either, bro. Have you met a gay guy? They’re handsome. They’re in good shape. They can fuck your girl so fast. Okay, be thankful they took a competitor off the board. I hate it so much, man. There’s such a pain in the ass. And as, as you can imagine, you all have the internet, it makes our job incredibly difficult. Nope, nobody’s allowed to joke about anything anymore. Everyone wants to complain about every joke ever told. That’s so frustrating because, I mean, no, you guys have been here the whole show, you know I have a pretty fucked up sense of humor. Like, I love dark shit. Like, the darker the better, to me. I love that so much. Keep that same energy. Like, I love fucked up stuff, but again, I’m okay making those jokes because I know my heart’s in the right place. And even though I acknowledge that that sense of humor isn’t for everybody, I’m okay with that because I don’t need to impress everybody. The same way you wouldn’t try to be friends with everybody, right? You’ll find your people as your life progresses. So, it’s like, yeah, I might get in trouble, or yeah, some people might not like the jokes that I tell, but I’m going to tell the jokes that I want to tell, and hopef',\n",
       "  'ully, my audience will gravitate towards that, and we can all get along and have a fucking cool friendship, you know. And it gets tricky sometimes. I’ll do jokes that a lot of people wouldn’t want to tell or don’t want to listen to. Sometimes, like, you know, sometimes I’ll do jokes about trans people because it’s funny sometimes. Not in a disrespectful way, it’s never disrespectful. I’m just making light of a situation so we can all laugh rather than be touchy and upset. That’s all it is. And this is what’s so funny: the energy in the room is exactly what I’m talking about. Subject matter is what triggers people. I haven’t even said the joke yet. All I’ve said was “trans people,” and everybody in here got a tigh asshole. Everybody, not you guys, but everybody else, everybody else tightened the fuck up. The special is presented by poppers. If you don’t know what poppers are, get you some gay friends. Change your life. [Applause] But that’s what I’m talking about. All I did was say a trigger word, and people are automatically already uncomfortable. You guys are worried about being canceled just being in the room. Like, it’s so funny to me because the jokes that I tell, they’re never disrespectful. They’re always with the utmost respect. It’s… I never want to hurt anybody’s feel… They’re just jokes, just to say some goofy shit make the world laugh, that’s all. And people will still come up after the show saying the same angry rant every time. Just fucking “You… you cannot make jokes about trans people. What they’re going through is so incomparable, and you can’t imagine how hard their life is, and the shit that they have to go through. Therefore, you cannot make jokes about trans people.” And I hear you, I hear you loud and clear. But… the point that you’re trying to make is, you’re saying I can’t make jokes about somebody because of how hard their life is. And you are making very valid points, that I don’t know how hard that life is. I imagine it is tremendously harder than my life. I can’t imagine how hard that is to go through, and I wish you the best of luck. But… at the same time, to retort that argument, you also don’t have the hardest life. You know who has life way harder than trans people, that we never talk about? People on wheelchairs. Think about it comparatively, people in wheelchairs have a much harder life. Do they complain about it? No. We gave them a couple of ramps and kept it pushing. We fucking… Look, somebody– some people are gonna think this is an insensitive comparison. I think it’s a step in the right direction personally. I think if we want to head towards trans equality, we fucking start with better parking, you know? It’s the least we could do. I don’t know where we’d put them, we can’t assign them anything. Just joking, just joking, okay, relax. Hey, look, if you let it be, this can be the most fun part of the show. Okay, if you just have fun for the next 15 minutes, we’re all gonna laugh at some things that we don’t think we’re allowed to laugh at. Oh, is it like a naughty thing if I laugh at a joke in a comedy show? Have fun. Okay, do not get sensitive now. Don’t fucking sit there and feel like you need to defend the wheelchair community. They can fucking stand up for themselves. Okay, God damn it, you guys. Stop being hesitant. Okay, look, people in wheelchairs come to comedy shows all the time. It is incredibly common. You know what? They are some of the best audience members you could ever ask for. They come, they laugh their asses off. And I’ll tell you the reason I believe that to be true. It’s because I think they’ve gotten themselves to this point of understanding and this positive mindset that no matter the hand you’ve been dealt in life, no matter how hard things might be for you, if you can learn to find the light in whatever dark situation you’re going through, and you can learn to laugh at the things that should make you miserable, including yourself sometimes, that’s how you fucking win life. And you are going to be a significantly happier person if you can learn to laugh in the face of adversity. I know this seems harsh, but I just have little to no respect for anybody who wakes up every day and makes the decision to live with a victim’s negative mentality of “oh, everything’s awful, everyone’s out to hurt my feelings.” Only because that’s not fair to you, that’s not fair to yourself. Your life is so short and so precious, you deserve to have the best fucking time you possibly can and laugh your way through life and be as happy as you can, no matter your circumstance or no matter what anybody fucking says about you. You deserve that. Have some fun. We’re only here for a second. Have some fun, man. And that’s why I chose the comparison that I did. A lot of people think it’s an insensitive comparison in the beginning, comparing those two groups. But it’s because of the positive message that I’m trying to put out there. And I want people to remember is that no matter what you’re going through, I would never negate that, but I want you to remember, if you think your life is hard, somebody has it worse. Try to remember that. Be grateful, be happy, and enjoy your time, no matter what. And that’s what I love about this example, is because if you think about the life of somebody in a wheelchair, that’s fucking hard. It’s a daily obstacle to overcome to do anything, every ',\n",
       "  'day. And the fact that they can laugh their way through that, we should all be able to. That’s what I have so much respect for the wheelchair community. [Applause] Because regardless of what they’re going through, people in wheelchairs are never annoying about their situation, until they’re getting on the bus. I don’t know how many of y’all have been stuck behind a city bus sending somebody in a wheelchair on, but it is fucking excruciating. You’re behind, I’m trying to make that right turn, and they’re fucking… “Put this motherfucker on the bike rack and let’s go!” That is the only time I have ever lost my patience on a handicapped person, is when they’re fucking up traffic. Okay, other than that, they’re angels. Look, if you’re still upset about the comparison, feel free to think about it and tell me I’m wrong. Let’s say you did, let’s say you took somebody with no legs and a trans person and you put them in the same room, the same handicap accessible room. See who you think has the harder life. “I just, I feel like I’m trapped inside of another person’s body.” “So, you have four legs?” “You’re… you’re not listening. It’s not about that. It’s a… Sometimes my mental health will take such a toll that I could just… I could just jump off of my balcony.” “Jump? What’s that?” “You’re… you’re not hearing… People will call me the wrong pronouns.” “Someone called me ‘Chariot Tubman’ the other day. You think a pronoun’s the worst thing you can be called? Come on.” Audience: What about a trans person in a wheelchair? Oh, you mean transportation? [Laughter] Don’t test me, dog. [Laughter] Oh, shit. Look, this is… this is a hard joke to pull off. It’s like a prosthetic leg; you just gotta… No, no, it is. It is, obviously, you take two marginalized groups of people who are going through a tough time, and you think you can’t make jokes about that, but you can. The joke works if my point is inarguable, and I think it is. I think those examples speak for themselves. I guess I just can’t wait for the day that I’m doing this joke at a show, and there’s a trans person in the audience who gets so offended they walk out, and I’m just like, “Show off.” [Applause] Some of y’all are still on edge, and it’s very annoying. Okay, I’m gonna give it one last try. I’m gonna give it one last try to get you all on my side. This is my last attempt to get through to y’all. Okay, I was working on this joke when it was like brand new, about eight weeks ago, right? I was in Arizona, and it’s a new joke. I’m trying to figure it out, obviously a little tricky to navigate, obviously a teeter on a very fine line of offensive and funny, which is where you want your jokes, you know. Have some fun, push the boundaries, you know. So, I’m working on it, I’m trying to make it the best it can be, and I can see out of the corner of my eye, front row, left side of the stage, is a young woman in a wheelchair. And I’m in the middle of like the trans versus wheelchair material, and I can see out of my peripheral vision, she’s laughing her ass off. She’s slapping her knee. She can’t feel it, but she’s slapping her knee, like, this bitch is rolling, you know what I mean? She’s fucking Ah, you know how they’d be laughing. Ah, handicapped people laugh like they’re getting good head, just… Ah. She’s so obviously having a great time, right? So when the joke was over, it dawned on me that I had a very unique opportunity to get an inside perspective on this material. And in order for a joke like this to work, it has to be funnier than it is offensive. And again, I want it to be, I never want to hurt anybody’s feelings. It’s just jokes, man. That’s as simple as that to me. But I’m always open to conversations. When the joke was over, I asked her, I was like, “Out of curiosity, was anything I said in that joke offensive?” And still laughing, this woman says, “No, no, no, no, no, it was… it was so fucking funny. And I want to thank you for including me.” I had never realized that so many people were so uncomfortable around handicapped people that a lot of the times, they won’t even laugh about some of the same things they want to laugh about, and things that they think are hilarious. So getting that confirmation is what gave me all the confidence I needed to know that these jokes are okay to tell, and we are allowed to laugh at them. You know, her and I, we were on the same page the whole time. We both know that’s what you do to vegetables; you roast them. [Applause] Bro, if you didn’t laugh at that shit, I would never be your friend. Fuck you, dude Fuck you, bro. Then I fucked her, that’s the crazy thing. It was after this show. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I’m not saying it was me, but she wasn’t walking the next day. I’m just saying, I’m just saying. I was like, “Can you feel it in your stomach?” She was like, “I can’t feel anything.” I was like, “Yeah.” My name is Matt Rife. Thank you guys so much for coming out. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause] Excellent. Um, thank you. [Applause] Listen, listen for one second. Um, first and foremost, thank you all so much. This means the absolute world to me. And I know, I know we laughed a lot in the past hour, but if you wouldn’t mind, there is something important I would actually like to share with you guys. And it’s something I wanted to address about the special. It’s very important to me. It’s the name of the ',\n",
       "  'special, “Matthew Stephen Rife.” Uh, it’s my full name. If you guys buy the DVD, you can get my Social Security number too, but it’s my full name, obviously Matthew and Rife being my first and last name, and my middle name being Steven. And I’m named after my grandpa. [Applause] The same… Pocket pussy Grandpa. And just to clarify, yes, that story is one thousand percent true, zero embellishment. He was… he’s a fucking monster. But the reason we’ve decided to name this special, it was gonna be named something totally different, and I wanted to dedicate this special to my grandpa because just under two weeks ago, he passed away. Um, and the whole show, I mean, this whole special taping almost didn’t happen. I mean, he was my absolute best friend, and I love him and miss him so much. He wasn’t able to come to my first special taping last year. So, for this one, I was like scrambling. I was like, “Do I even want to do this? It doesn’t feel right to do a show without him.” So, I mean, we’ve scrambled together, we changed some of the set for it. It’s like, um, this right here is his hat that he wore every single day. There’s even a photo, it’s a black and white photo of like, he and I when I was a baby. I think, I mean clearly, we were on the set of one of his 70s pornos. And like I said, he, he wasn’t able to come to my first special taping last year because it was kind of the height of COVID and everything. He also hadn’t been on a plane in like 30 years. So, for this one, a couple of months ago, like four or five months ago, when we decided we were going to do this special, I really, really wanted to fly him out here. He was very excited too, because I wanted to kind of immortalize and, in front of everybody that was here, tell him just how much he meant to me and just thank him for every single thing that he did. [Applause] You guys really don’t understand. Um, I spent every weekend with him when I was a kid. Like, he’s the one that showed me, like, all these funny things. We would sit around, watch Adam Sandler movies, and stuff like that, you know? Very inappropriate movies for a job. Um, and he was very funny. Like, he’s definitely the reason I have a sense of humor. When I was starting out doing stand-up, when I was 15, um, how open mics work, a lot of the times, I started out at the local comedy club in Columbus, Ohio, called the Funny Bone. And they would have these open mics. And how those work a lot of times is they’re called bringer shows. So you’d have to bring five people in order for you to get stage time. I was 15, all my friends were in middle school, so obviously I couldn’t have anybody come. So my Grandpa would buy five tickets so that I could get stage time and do this silly thing because he thought I was so funny. [Applause] I really wish he was here to see all of you people here. And just to let you guys know, if I have ever made any of you laugh ever, it’s because of him. [Applause] That’s why, when we were going over the stage decoration for how we were going to do this stage, I wanted it kind of plain and rugged. Um, but then, obviously, I wanted him here at the show so bad, which is why we decided to leave a seat open for him on the stage, want to watch the show. And as heartbreaking as it is that he couldn’t come and be at the show himself, um, fortunately enough, Ashley could. [Applause] So, in the name of Steve, this one’s for you, Papaw. [Applause] Hey, everybody, thank you so, so much for tuning in to this special. This is our second self-produced special, and it means the absolute world to me that you guys tuned in in support of this. And for anybody who might want to show any additional support, we just added a bunch of new merch on my website at mattrifeofficial.com. We just added t-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, hats, bracelets that you can actually pay anything you want for. And all the money we are making for Merch is going towards the next Third self-produced special we’re putting out next year. And to top it off, we are going to auction off the star of the second special, not me, um, Ashley herself. And I have signed it for you. It’s from me. It’s from the show. It’s a little creepy, a little sexy, a little gross. My grandpa for sure possesses it. But so can you. So thank you so much again for tuning in. I hope you enjoyed it and see you at the next one.

       " ['Your Friend, Nate Bargatze (2024)\\nGenre: Comedy, Stand-up\\nDirector: Ryan Polito\\nStar: Nate Bargatze\\nPremiered on Netflix on December 24, 2024 Nate Bargatze’s 2024 Netflix stand-up special, Your Friend, Nate Bargatze, is a comedic journey through the absurdities of everyday life. With his signature deadpan delivery, Bargatze riffs on relatable topics like pizza-ordering dilemmas, domestic quirks with his frugal wife, and parenting mishaps, weaving personal anecdotes with exaggerated humor. The show opens with a spirited introduction from his daughter, setting the stage for a performance rooted in self-deprecating humor, small-town nostalgia, and sharp observations about modern absurdities. Bargatze’s storytelling shines as he recounts his days as a water meter reader, his failed attempts to manage daily routines without his wife’s guidance, and his humorous take on aging and familial dynamics. The special thrives on Bargatze’s ability to find comedy in the mundane, whether it’s debating the dominance of dogs sleeping in beds or lamenting the complexities of fast-food drive-throughs. His observations on generational quirks, from his parents’ idiosyncrasies to his own aging mishaps, resonate universally. The show crescendos with his musings on societal advancements, juxtaposed with his small-town upbringing, culminating in laugh-out-loud reflections on AI, modern hotels, and outdated services like wake-up calls. Through it all, Bargatze maintains a warm and engaging rapport with his audience, delivering a feel-good hour of humor that blends sharp wit with heartfelt relatability. * * * [crowd cheering] [“Sunday Best” by Surfaces playing] Please welcome my daddy, Nate Bargatze! ♪ Feeling good, like I should ♪ [crowd cheering] ♪ Went and took a walk Around the neighborhood ♪ ♪ Feeling blessed, never stressed ♪ ♪ Got that sunshine On my Sunday best, yeah… ♪ I love you. ♪ Every day can be a better day Despite the challenge ♪ ♪ All you gotta do is leave it Better than you found it ♪ ♪ It’s gonna get difficult to stand But hold your balance ♪ ♪ I just say whatever ‘Cause there is no way around it ♪ Thank you.

Thank you. That’s very nice. [crowd whooping] This is it. We’re doing it. Uh… So… My… I love… Look, I love doing stand-up comedy. I love it. And the job I had, the last serious job, the job I will go back to when all this falls apart… [crowd laughing] I was a water meter reader. [scattered cheering] Thank you. This job was… The title was the description of what you do. [crowd laughing] People would ask, I’d go, “I’m a water meter reader.” “Yeah, what’s that?” Let me tell you what it is, all right? We’re going to read water meters. That’s the… That’s 100% of the job. So back when I did it, it was in Wilson County, Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. And so, back when I did it, I would have to park the truck, and like get out in the neighborhood. Like, run through a neighborhood, and type in how much water every house uses. So it’s 2001. Obviously, 9/11 happens. If you’re old enough, you remember when 9/11 happened, the whole country got very scared there was going to be more attacks. Well, we did as well in Wilson County. We figured, they just went to New York, obvious next stop, Mt. Juliet, Tennessee. [crowd laughing] And they are going to poison our town’s water. So they got all of us water meter readers to guard the water tanks. I really did this. I stood… just in a dark field, alone, waiting for the Taliban to show up. No weapons, no training. They gave us a lantern. A lantern! That does nothing but shows your body as you hold it up. I can’t see two feet in front of me. If someone’s got a gun, they’re like, “Shoo',\n",
       "  't at the only light in that field.” I’m going to put it over my heart to see. I’m like, “What’s going on?” I mean, I think, like, to this day, I’ve always said, what did they want us to do? Call the Mt. Juliet Police? “Osama is here.” “He got past our lanterns.” “He’s in the water tank. He knew how to open that. We were…” “We were surprised by that, but he knew what he was doing.” My wife was with me when I had that job. She’s been with me way before where we’re at right now. She was in it for the benefits I got at the water company. Uh… [Nate chuckles] We have, uh… So we’ve been married 17 years. [crowd cheering] Thank you. And, uh, I know… You know, the longer I’m married, the more I realize why she was put in my life. I would not be here if she was not in my life. I know all of this. Now, I’ve also become very reliant on her because of this. I don’t know anything about me. Like… I don’t know what I like and don’t like to eat. [crowd laughing] I mean, someone would be like, “You want to try this?” And I got to get her involved. I’m like, “I don’t think so.” I don’t know how long to microwave something. I have to ask her every time, as if her family invented the microwave. “How long do we microwave this for?” And she’s like, “Do it till it’s hot.” It’s like, “But I know you know a number. You know, just…” “Just say the number. I don’t…” “I’m either gonna call my mom, or you’re gonna tell me the number.” If she doesn’t tell me, I type in 90 minutes and I walk away. [Nate laughs] I do do my own laundry. [crowd cheering] Thanks. Thank you. I think that’s what it deserves. My mom did my dad’s laundry growing up, so I thought all wives do husbands’ laundry. And I’ve always done my own, and to be honest, I felt it had been forgotten about over these past 17 years. The sacrifice I was making that other husbands didn’t have to make. One day, I was driving home and it popped in my head, and I was like, “All right, I’ll bring that up.” I mean, I didn’t bring it up that day, you know? I was like, I’m sure there will be a time where we’ll be in some fight, I’ll be losing this fight… and then, I mean, I just come, I’m like, “I do my own laundry!” She’s like, “Fight’s over!” “You win. I forgot how good I got it.” So I sit on it for, like, six months, like a long… [laughs] We finally get in a fight. I don’t remember what the fight was about. Nothing. I don’t know. It wasn’t laundry. I remember that. So, I’m losing this fight. And so, in my head I’m like, “This is it.” I mean, honestly, I was sad to see it go. That’s how good I felt. I felt bad for her. I mean… I was like, “She thinks she’s winning this fight.” “I’m about to drop a bomb on her right now.” [crowd laughing] So just out of nowhere, I just go, “I do my own laundry!” And I said it like, “They don’t make them like this no more.” I was shocked that it started a second fight I never saw coming. [crowd laughing, applauding] [Nate laughs] Thanks. We do laundry very differently. She’ll read the labels, I’ll wash a rug and a suit together. I’m… I don’t know. “You wanna put your shoes in there? Put your shoes.” The washing machine’s always a foot from the wall when I get done. [chuckles] It’s like, “That was a lot of stuff you put in there.” You know? Yeah. “And look, it’s almost all wet.” I travel a lot. Obviously. So she’ll be at home with our daughter. We have a wonderful daughter, as you have seen. And… [crowd cheering] But I know it’s hard. You know, she’s home, my wife has to be the mom and the dad, and the good and the bad parent. You know, and I come home and I’m super fun. Or I’ll mess up the routine. This is just stuff she tells me. And… [crowd laughing] Like, I’ll go… When I go home, I’ll lay in bed with our daughter and then we get in trouble for talking. I’m not the one talking, by the way. But we get yelled at as if I’m the one talki',\n",
       "  \"ng. I do get it, because I don’t think of the consequences with everything. Like, we have one dog. I would like another dog. My wife does not want another dog, because it’s a lot. It’s a lot to have two dogs, ’cause you got to open the back door and let two dogs out. [crowd laughing] Then you shut it, and now… now they’re out there. You’re inside, not dealing with it, but… But then they want to come back in and you’re like, [grumpily] “Got to go let all these dogs back in.” You’re like, “One dog, two… Look at all these dogs everywhere.” Look, I… To be honest, I’ve never taken care of the one dog we have, but… Two? Two would be fun. Our dog sleeps in our bed, and someone told me you’re not supposed to do that, ’cause you lose dominance over the dog. And, you know, I asked him, I said, “What year do you think it is?” These are all doodles. They’re barely dogs. It’s a person. They’re people. This guy acts like it’s 1980 when you kept the dog outside all year. Those, you needed dominance over. You had a wolf in the backyard. Friends come over. “You want to go outside?” “I wouldn’t.” She’s the cheaper one of us, as well. Not in a bad way, you know. She likes the lights being off. Turn the lights off, you know, save money. Turn the… Get the lights. All the lights off, it’s a fun time, being in that environment. Turn the light on, find your seat. Get a stick, knock the light back off. Sit in the dark and be sad and just be… just sad all day. But you’re saving nickels upon nickels. Right when I get in bed, “You turn that light off?” “I can’t tell if that’s on.” “Well, get out of bed, turn it off.” Eighty years, we’ll give our daughter the $37 from all the nickels we saved. All right, look, I can be wasteful. Like, if something gets to the bottom, I will throw it away. Ketchup. If ketchup gets, like, that much left, I’m like, “Bleh.” She will put the old ketchup with the new ketchup. That way your ketchup’s always gross. [crowd laughing] Toothpaste. I will use it to what I think the average person uses it to. I don’t think I should feel muscles trying to get it out. I’m not going to have an iron on top of it. But she’ll do it more. So I know when I’m done with it, I give it to the hobo I married. She cuts it, gets it all out. I married an old man from the Depression, is who I married. She would have thrived during the Depression. I don’t think she would’ve known there was a Depression. A pizza party is my nightmare. I’ll have friends over for pizza. So I’ll be like, “All right, we gotta order pizza.” And she goes, “How much?” I go, “Order the most.” “I don’t want to run out of pizza in front of my friends.” She goes, “Just call and ask them.” I go, “I can’t call these 40-year-old dudes and just be like, ‘How much pizza do you think you’re gonna eat tonight?'” They have a real… They have a family. They work in a building, right now. You want me to call and be like, “You have a big lunch today?” “No, we’re trying to save money, so I need to know exactly how much pizza you’re going to eat in eight hours.” I just want to buy stuff and her not know I bought it, and… that’s so hard. I think if I knew the name of my bank, I could do it. But I got to go through her to get that information. I poke around, I’ll be like, “If I had a bank, what bank do you think I would go to?” I also, once a week, walk into a bank and go, “Hello, is my money in this bank?” She has to get me out of stuff all the time. If I buy something and it doesn’t fit, I’ll never take it back. I’m embarrassed. I’m pretty sure it’s going to be the exact same people. And they remember me. And right when I walk in, they’ll be like, “We knew you couldn’t handle that shirt.” She takes back groceries to the grocery store. [incredulously] Yeah. Food. I… Honestly, I don’t think it’s allowed. I… Honest. I think she’s bullying these 15-year-old c\",\n",
       "  'hildren. They don’t know what to do. Their mom walks in being like, “Your bananas got weird too quick.” And they’re like, “What?” “You picked them out. They’re not mine. What are you talking about?” “I’m gonna change them. I’mma go change them out.” “Yeah, that lady is stealing bananas.” Recently, I was walking to my car and I had a college kid come up and he was raising money, uh… You know, for nature. Or it was for Earth. It was nature and Earth. Uh… I don’t know. He used real words. But it was, you know, basically… I felt he even looked at me, like, “It’s going to Earth.” I was like, “Yeah. Well, Earth is going through it right now.” So… He was telling me everything Earth is going through. You know, it’s pollution. He said, “Our water’s being poisoned.” You know, I said, “Not under my watch, but I understand.” [crowd laughing, cheering] I think I was buying a tree, I don’t really know. But I tried to give him cash and he was like, “Oh, you got to do a credit card.” I was like, “Okay.” So, I give a random iPad all my family information. It was $75. So he, like, swipes the card, and then after it goes through, he goes, “Just so you know, it’s a monthly charge.” [crowd gasps] Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. He told me after. And he was like, “Look, you can cancel it on the website.” I was like, “I don’t know what’s going on right now.” He goes, “Put your email down for the receipt.” I was like, “All right.” I just put my wife’s email address down. Guess who’s going to put a stop to this real fast? [crowd laughing, cheering] She’ll have that tree cut down tomorrow. I called her, ’cause I have to call her when I sign us up for stuff, and… [chuckles] She answered the phone, just goes, “I’m on it.” Hung up. She runs everything. She does stuff, doesn’t tell me. We got a new roof, and I did not know that. A whole new roof, I found out from my neighbors. They were like, “How’s that new roof going?” I go, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” And they go, “You didn’t know you got a new roof?” I go, “No, I did not.” And then I had to go get her, I was like, “You gotta go talk about that new roof you didn’t tell me about.” “I looked like an idiot out there.” We live… So, in our neighborhood, we live in a cul-de-sac, which is very exciting, because I grew up on a straight street… and I always dreamed of living in a cul-de-sac. You see them and you’re like, “Can you imagine being up in one of those?” We do all the cul-de-sac stuff, you know. Like, if anybody comes down there, we’re like, “What are you doing down…” Just, any car. We’re like, “You better get out of our cul-de-sac.” We take our trash out, uh… one of the days. I don’t know the day, but it’s a day. We’re doing it. There is one day. I know we forgot to take it out a couple weeks ago. That stress could break up a family. All week was like, “Everybody, eat out of your hands.” We had friends over, “Put your trash in your pockets, take it to your homes.” We got very lucky with our neighbors. Our neighbors are super cool, and we’re very close with them. Uh, they all have real jobs. They, like, went to college and stuff. And… one of them is a management consultant, so he manages all the consultants and… Yeah, it’s a tough job. All right? There’s a lot of consultants and he’s like, “You better get back.” You know? “You can’t…” “Just can’t consult up in here.” So, he’s busy. Our other neighbor’s an actuary. I thought that was with birds. I was like, “What’s that bird right there?” He goes, “I don’t know.” And I was like… [crowd laughing, cheering] “As an actuary, you don’t know what that bird is right there?” I went to career day for my daughter’s school, and, like, I get what I do is very fun, but I was nervous, ’cause I’m there with real people and they’re smart, and… So I was hoping to sit at a table alone. They put me at a table with a surgeon. W',\n",
       "  'hich I… I think they did it on purpose. Almost to show the kids, “Here’s the difference between reading.” [crowd laughing, cheering] So the kids, like, come up, you know, and they’re like, “What subjects do you use for comedy?” And I was like, I don’t even know what subjects they’re taking. Uh… I was like, “I do English. I do mostly English onstage.” They asked him, “How long do you go to school to be a surgeon?” You know, and he’s like, “54 years,” or whatever. It’s like… They asked me, they’re like, “How long to be a comedian?” I was like, “You’re good now.” So… “Look, finish elementary school, make your parents happy, but then I’d get out and get after it.” I had a hard time in school. There was… I got… I barely graduated, got into a community college, barely got into a college they have to let everybody in. I went to community college for one year, I have zero credits. Community college, a lot of people don’t know, is college when they’re like, “You’re probably going to stay in your community. So…” “We’re just going to show you the ropes around town.” “Kind of give you a lay of the land.” That whole year, I don’t have credits, because I had to take remedial classes. Which remedial is basically for… They’re classes for someone my age now trying to go back to school because they don’t remember school. And I took them right out of school. I just… They’re like, “You don’t remember school?” I was like, “I just came from school.” They go, “It looks like you’ve never heard about it.” Everybody in there was, like, 50. I’m like, “Well, who’s the teacher?” “I think you have to tell me if I ask. Who’s the teacher?” I took such basic… I took Speech. In college. I’d go… I would ride there with my friends, going to a business class or something. Whatever you go to. I was like, “All right, I’ll catch you after Speech.” And I still say a lot of words wrong, that’s what I don’t understand. I say, uh, “Poim.” “Poim.” Which no one ever knows. Uh, poem. Like… Yeah. P-O-E-M. I go, “poim.” Well, fix that, Speech class. What if I want to be a “poim” writer? What if I have a lot of great “poim” ideas? And no one takes me serious, ’cause I’m like, “Listen to my poims.” “Ol.” I say, “Ol.” A super Southern one. Uh… Oil. I don’t even know how to say it. Like, to y’all. Oil. O-I-L. Yeah. Yes. [laughs] I go, “Motor ol.” Like, “Tinfol.” I mean, Southern community college, that should be mandatory that they fix that. They should write O-I-L on the board, and I just go, “Ol.” They go, “We’re gonna take care of that. All right?” “There’s a pretty good chance you’re gonna be working with a lot of that.” “Silver War.” That’s how I say it. Instead of “Civil.” I go, “Silver War.” Because… You know? Look, that might be on me. All right? I’m not… I’ll tell you, I don’t even know anything about the “Silver War.” I don’t know anything about history. And I can tell, because every history movie I watch, I watch on the edge of my seat. [laughing, applause] “What is gonna happen?” I watched Pearl Harbor. I was just as surprised as they were, you know? I don’t read. Yeah, and I think that matters. Reading is the key to smart, I believe. And… I don’t do it. I think it’s caught up to me. I want to do it. I like the idea of reading. I even buy books, but these books are the most words. And… It’s every book. You just open it and you’re like, “What are you talking about?” It… I mean… And they don’t let up. Every page, just more words. How about you put some blank pages in there? Why don’t you let me get my head above water for two seconds? [crowd laughing, applauding] My eyes can read good. It’s my brain. My eyes are such good readers. I feel so bad, ’cause they’re attached to this dumb brain. I mean, they’re looking at these words, they’re like, “You’re not getting any of this, man?” “That’s the fifth time we’ve read that sentence. ',\n",
       "  'Let’s try another one.” Fiction, non-fiction. I don’t know which one’s the truth. I read every book as the truth is how I handle it. From what I can tell, we have a pretty big wizard problem in this country right now. We went to… Like, we went to Europe last year. And by the way, on the way to… We were flying from Nashville to London, and we go, uh… It was 4:42 p.m. Nashville time. So as a game, as a family, I said, “Let’s guess what time it is in London.” So I said 12:42 a.m. Our daughter said 1:42 a.m. My wife, her guess was 11. And that’s it. Yeah, she didn’t say the 42. And, I was like, “Just say the 42.” She goes, “You know what I mean.” I go, “I know, but just… show our daughter you know what a normal person would say.” That started a pretty big fight. If you go to Europe, just so you know, uh… it’s the most old. It’s very old. You think we’re old, and you get there and you’re like, “Good night.” Uh… “What have y’all been doing over here?” You just walk around, they’re like, “That building is from 8.” You’re like, “Good golly.” Went to Australia as well. Australia’s very far away. I’m going to tell you, our Earth is bigger than I thought it was. We flew 16 hours, over 500 miles an hour. Barely made it. Barely. I think we went the wrong way, as well. I had jet lag there. I did not mind it, ’cause I woke up early. I woke up at 5:45 a.m., and I don’t ever wake up that early. So I was, like, first in line at the breakfast buffet. Here’s what I will tell you, when you get up at 5:45 a.m. noon is pretty far away. I mean, you will bet your life it’s noon, and it’s maybe 8:30. By 6:00 p.m., it’s like, “How are people out?” “Why won’t the sun go down?” That’s the next phase of my life, getting up early, you know? We’re starting. We get up at 9:15 a little bit. Yeah. You know. I’ve never seen my daughter go to school, but I’ve been close. I’m cold now too, that I’m old. Forty-five. I just get cold, I always have to bring a jacket. It could be 135 degrees outside and I will walk around with a jacket. And I see these young people, and I just think, “Where are your jackets?” My body’s falling apart. My… My shoulder hurts, ’cause I stand onstage like this. It’s crazy. This was a huge mistake to get into this. If I had known that this would be a big problem, I would have probably tried to not make it a habit. My body can’t handle this. And I went to the doctor to try to fix it… I mean, they talked to me like I was an old car. He goes, “I wouldn’t put any more money into it, to be honest.” I pulled a muscle recently, I guess it was in my soul. I mean, it was dead middle of my body… I thought it was the front. Then I was like, “Well, my back hurts too.” You know? So… Well, what’s in the middle? What muscle is in the middle? I went hiking. I jumped off a rock. I mean, a foot high. When I landed, it felt what I would imagine being struck by lightning feels like. I felt it through my fingernails. Fifty-fifty if my zipper’s up or down anymore. It’s a true flip of the coin. I don’t know what’s happening. I’ve zipped up my whole life. And now, just head out, like, “All right, see you boys later.” Just head out. Take my pants off at home. They come off easy. I’m like, “Ah, that was four hours I was walking around like…” I think it’s ’cause I’m peeing so much longer. And I’m not used to this new old rhythm yet. ‘Cause in your 40s, there’s a lot of false stops. You learn pretty quick to be like, “Let’s hang back.” “Let’s let traffic thin out a little bit.” I watch young people come and go. I’m like, “Tell my family I’m okay.” Food is still… I still have a problem with food. I… I love processed food. I love it. I’m a farm-factory-table guy. [crowd laughing, cheering] I want… I want the most hands involved in my food. It’s coming to an end. You can feel… I can feel it. I can’t do it anymore. It really hurts.',\n",
       "  ' I… You know, and I tell myself, like, “I’ve done it. I was…” Yeah, my jersey would be retired of eating fast food. I’ve done all the stuff. I’ve had Taco Bell and threw it away in my neighbor’s trash so my wife didn’t find out. I used so much ketchup once at a restaurant, that a stranger walked up to me and goes, “That’s a lot of ketchup.” Do you know how much ketchup you got to use? That guy doesn’t want to get involved, you know? But he sees it. I mean, his wife’s like, “Let it go.” He’s like, “I think I got to say something. I don’t…” “I don’t think he knows that we’re all… No one’s using that much ketchup.” I went to a McDonald’s drive-through and my window did not roll down. That’s the universe saying, “Give it a rest.” And I fought through it. It’s embarrassing, because they can tell, because I had to pull past… Because I got to open my door, so it’s going to hit the speaker. So I gotta drive by it. So the car behind me is like, “Are you leaving?” I’m like, “My window don’t roll down.” And I got to open the door. Now the speaker is by the gas tank. So I gotta yell my order out. Now that guy hears it. And then I look at McDonald’s screen, well, they got it all on the board, just let the neighborhood know what I’m ordering. And then I drove by the window, the drive-through window, and I got to go by it, ’cause I got to open my whole door. So I go by it, and I see them, they’re like, “Where are you going?” I was like, “Nowhere.” And I go by, and they see my whole body sitting in a chair. It’s crazy. If you’ve never done it, it’s the most vulnerable I ever felt in my life. Just… You’re just sitting there, and you’re like, “Hi.” They see your feet. They see your feet. They just throw it at me like a bear, just throw it. Our family, we just eat a lot of fast food. Our family text thread, my dad texted, he was like, “I found a way to get a Big Mac cheaper.” And he said, “You can order a double cheeseburger and ask for Big Mac sauce.” So he goes, “It’s cheaper, and they get rid of that third bun, so it’s Atkins.” Uh… That’s how you do it. That third bun is the one you’re like, “I don’t know if I need the third bun.” My parents are getting older, they’re not super old, but they’re at the age where, you know, if they trip, they will fall to the ground. There’s just an age where it hap… I mean… Like, if I trip, my body hasn’t touched the ground in 40 years. But for them, it’s just, I don’t know. It’s like the upper is like, “We’re going.” And… the lower is like, “What?” And it’s just… Boom. And I mean, there’s no, like, “Whoa.” It’s just, they don’t even know what’s happening. They’re just looking at you and you’re like, “You’re not feeling any of this?” And they hit the ground so hard. It’s like they got thrown off a roof. Everybody hears it, they’re like, “What’s going on?” I’m like, “My parents are down!” “I got to get ’em up.” “My mom’s got a bruise that won’t go away for two years.” I just walk ahead of them now. I’m like a Sherpa. Just let them know the terrain that we’re about to hit. “Got a little carpet coming up.” “Got a little carpet. When we go outside, a little brighter than inside.” “Yeah, and cobblestone. You ain’t gonna make that. So…” “Lay down. Lay down on the carpet.” “I’m gonna back the car up in the building.” We had my mom go pick up our daughter recently at a friend’s house, and I texted her the address, and she drove to the wrong house. She knocked on the door, another grandmother answered. Well, this is no good. This is like two dogs seeing each other through a fence. It’s gonna be hard to get them both back inside. So, my mom, she goes, “Is my granddaughter there?” And the other lady goes, “I have three grandsons.” No solution. Just two grandmothers. “You have… You have stuff? I have stuff too.” They talked for 30 minutes. It’s the wrong door! I had to go get my da',\n",
       "  'ughter, then find my mom. And wives are the ones that keep it together the longest in a relationship. If you see an old married couple, like, 80-year-old… They’re 80, the wife is just… She’s with it. And her husband’s like, “Where are we at right now?” Like, he… I mean, our brains fall off a cliff, dude. Like, they’re… The only reason he’s out is because she’s like, “You better get out and let people see you a little bit.” It’s like some zookeeper walking some old gorilla around. “Let the kids touch you.” Everybody’s trying to feed him. “Don’t feed him that.” “I think he wants it.” “He definitely wants it. He’s too dumb to know he can’t have it.” My dad goes to the hospital all the time. I mean, he… He has surgery eight times a year, probably. He loves it. He loves it. The doctor will go, “Look, you could just stretch.” And he goes, “Let’s just do the surgery.” He had surgery ’cause he was addicted to Afrin, the nose spray. Yeah. Look, I… I got addicted to Afrin as well. I would honestly tell you, if you don’t know what it is, I would tell you not to get involved. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever been part of. When I was on it too, my wife was furious. I had to try to hide it from her. She could hear it from three blocks away. Just one little puff, “What’s that?” “I ain’t gonna live like this!” “I ain’t work this hard not to do Afrin in my own home.” So my dad, they go to the doctor, him and my mom. And the doctor was like, “Do you use Afrin?” And my dad goes, “No.” And the doctor was like, “I can tell that you use it.” “I was just saying that.” So… He goes, “How long have you used it?” And my dad said, “Five years.” Which is a lie. And my mom, she’s like, “Well, tell the truth.” You know, she goes, “He’s used it for 45 years.” He used Afrin 45 years. Just for reference, if you don’t know, the back of the box suggests no more than three days. I mean, there’s not a medicine on Earth that tells you to give it a good 45-year run. I think about my parents a lot because, I mean, the world is getting very futuristic. And, like them, I’m from the 1900s. You got to watch out for the 1900s people. We’re old. [crowd cheering] It’s so… I mean, my great-aunt Helen from the ’30s. She’s deaf. They didn’t know she was deaf back then. The doctors, they had no idea. They were baffled. That’s how… That’s how good doctors were back then. They just said… They looked at her as they smoked in her face. These were real doctors. They were like, “I don’t know.” “She’s rude. I’ll tell you that.” I mean, I think what I saw growing up… I mean, we would go watch… My dad’s a magician. So we would go watch my dad do magic at the Wilson County Fair. County fairs are great. If you never… They’re still going around. I don’t think the government knows about them, but… I mean, we ride these rides that were on the interstate an hour ago. So we would go watch my dad. So my dad would do magic. Right next to him, they had a donkey jumping off a high dive into a pool. So pretty hard to keep everybody’s attention. When my dad is like, “Is this your card?” And everybody’s like, “This donkey’s about to jump off this high dive.” That’s something you don’t think you wanna see, till it’s up there. And I use the word “jump” very loosely. These donkeys are falling off this high dive. But you can’t put that on the sign, you know? “You gonna watch a donkey fall off a high dive?” “No.” “Okay.” “What if he jumped?” “Well, at least he’s into it.” So the donkey would go up this ramp, like, 40 feet in the air. And it would just stand there ’cause it doesn’t want to jump. It’s not in on this, so… But it gets stuck ’cause donkeys can’t walk backwards. Not positive if that is true, but I… I’ve never seen a donkey go backwards. I’ve never even really looked, but I honestly think, 45 years, I would have seen a couple donkeys go backwards. So',\n",
       "  ' the donkey stands there, and a dog, he sends a dog up the ramp, it barks at the donkey and the donkey jumps in the pool. And as someone that has seen this, I tell you, when that donkey hits the water, you’re like, “We should probably get out of here. Uh…” It’s not as fun as you thought it would be. I mean, this is going to sound dumb, but you’re really surprised you’re seeing what the sign said you would see. PETA got a hold of that. They shut it down. And that was one I think everybody was like, “Fair enough, we get that.” Another one PETA had to shut down, this was again, like, the 1980s. I was alive. You could fight an orangutan at a fair. They would have an orangutan just sitting in a boxing ring and guys would pay to fight it. And I say “guys,” because I just can’t imagine one woman ever fought this orangutan. I think you can put an orangutan in a room with a thousand women, and when they walked out, like, “Did anybody fight it?” “It never crossed our mind to fight it.” [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Put three men in that room, two of those men will fight that orangutan. The other one would’ve started it, going, “I think y’all should fight that orangutan.” So, guys get in there and they’re like, “All right, we’ll go fight this orangutan.” And the orangutan would just knock everybody out. Because we don’t have the internet to look up, “How strong is an orangutan?” It’s all word-of-mouth back then. You had to meet a guy that just fought an orangutan. You’re like, “But the arms are skinny.” He’s like, “I know. That’s what made me get in there as well.” [crowd laughing, applauding] So PETA put a stop to that also. Yeah. Look, whatever you want to say about PETA, they did some real work in the 1900s. There’s… The first… One of the first things they had to do, car manufacturers, before crash test dummies were invented, they would use a pig in a car wreck. So they sit a pig I guess upright. And this little pig… Pigs are smart. Pretty good day for this pig. It’s like, “You gonna let me drive a car?” Pretty fun, pretty fun day. He’s got his elbow out. “Are y’all kidding me right now? You gonna let me drive this car?” I don’t even know what that shows you. Pigs don’t have necks. That’s what I was around when I was growing up. I mean, I look at my daughter, and I have more in common with a Pilgrim. And Pilgrims believed in witches. Little side note, I would like to say, I think the witch phase was the toughest phase for women to have to go through. Not to get serious, but a lot of people say voting. I disagree. I think it’s witch, then voting. I think it’s witch, pretty big gap, then, you know, voting. You jaywalk back then, the whole town’s like, “There’s a witch.” You’re like, “Here we go. Here we go!” And I’ll give it to ’em, because they could’ve flown away, but none of them ever did. [chuckles] All right, sorry. That… Look. Just trying to get a witch joke in, it’s pretty complicated. There’s a lot of moving parts. You got to bring up Pilgrims somehow. I took a typing class in seventh grade. That’s how… [crowd applauding, whooping] And I thought it was a waste of my time. I… In my head, I was like, “Who’s going to be typing?” “Cursive is the future.” [crowd laughing, applauding] That’s why I… ‘Cause the future… I don’t know what’s going… I don’t know technology. I don’t know what AI is. I don’t think you get to know what AI is and also see a donkey jump off a high dive. I think it was one or the other, and I saw the donkey, so I’m out. If I send an email and it says the file is too big, I don’t know what to do. My best guess is… I try to resend it. That’s what I try to… You know how dumb that is? The computer’s like, “No.” And I go, “What about now, though?” Hotels are getting futuristic. A lot of hotels, when I stay at, now, when you take a shower, they have half a glass. So, it’s op',\n",
       "  'en. So the water gets on the floor. Because that’s the future. They want water on the floor. And I’m old and dumb, I come… You know, we really tried to keep the water inside the tub. It was a pretty big deal, but now, they want the floors wet, that’s what they want. They want to do no glass, but I’m still alive, so they’re like, “All right, do half a glass.” “Once that guy’s gone, we’ll do no glass, floors are wet, drains off the balcony.” When I first started going on the road, I would have to do a wake-up call. That’s how I got up in the morning. I’d have to call a guy I don’t know, and just be like, “Will you wake me up tomorrow?” [crowd laughing, applauding] That’s the last person I would talk to, was him. I would call my wife, then a man I’ve never seen. “You promise you gonna wake me up tomorrow?” We would tell each other good night. So no one’s done a wake-up call in probably 20 years now. So this guy on the road with us, he’s 24 years old, he’s never done a wake-up call in his life. And so, we’re staying at a hotel, and he saw the wake-up call on the phone. And he goes, “I’m going to do a wake-up call.” And I told him, I go, “Don’t do it.” “I mean, that’s like an ashtray on an airplane.” He was like, “No, I want to do it.” “All right.” So he set it up. Next morning, his phone rings, he doesn’t answer the phone. He doesn’t know that’s the main part of your job. You gotta answer the phone and let the guy know you’re awake. So then that guy, who’s young too probably, is like, “I guess I got to go knock on the door.” “I’ve never even seen this service used so it must be the most important person alive.” So he goes up and he starts knocking on the door. My buddy still doesn’t answer the door. So the guy goes in the room. I swear this is real, ’cause look, this is two young people, they don’t know what they’re doing. So he goes in the room, like, “Do I have to touch this guy?” “Is that what a wake-up call is?” “I gotta touch a guy I’ve never seen, in the dark?” So I’d imagine he started making noises, just going, “Hep. Hey, now! Hep!” “Hep, hep, hep. Hep!” Hoping he doesn’t have to touch this man. But he had to touch him. I swear, that’s what he told me. He woke up to another guy going, “Hey, buddy.” “It’s time to wake up.” Thank you so much.

       " ['Original air date: October 28, 2023 Ladies and gentlemen, Nate Bargatze! [Cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s very exciting. It’s crazy. I’m as– look, if you’re at home, I’m as shocked as you are that I’m here. I’ve come to this building for a long time, so it’s unreal to be here at “Saturday Night Live.” It’s crazy. It’s all right there. My name is Nate Bargatze. I’m from Tennessee. I’m also from the 1900s. And– [laughter] I just think you got to say it. Like the world is so future now. And I feel in the way of it. Hotels, hotels are futuristic. You take a shower, the shower’s enclosed. But now a lot of hotels have half a glass, and water gets on the floor. And that’s the future. That’s ',\n",
       "  'what the future– that’s what they want. And, you know, I would like a whole– they do half a glass because I’m still alive, so they’re like– they don’t want to hear me going “where’s the glass?” at, so they do half a glass. In the future, the floor is always wet, every floor. I mean, I think– I’m 44. My daughter’s 11. When she’s my age, it’ll be 2057. I don’t even believe that’s a real year. My movies didn’t go that high in fake years. How am I going to talk to someone from 2057? I have more in common with a pilgrim. [Laughter] I saw too much old-timey stuff. I’m pre-internet. We go to a county fair, Wilson County fair — this is in Tennessee if you’re wondering — and we would go there– fairs, I don’t know how they’re still open. I d',\n",
       "  'on’t think the government knows about them. We ride these rides that were on the interstate an hour ago. [Laughter] So, my dad is a magician if you don’t know, and we would go watch him perform. This is the ’80s. So we go watch him, my dad’s doing magic. Right next to him, they had donkeys jumping off a high dive into a pool. So pretty tough to keep people’s attention when my dad is like, is this your card? And everybody’s like, hold on, this donkey’s about to jump off this high dive. That’s something you don’t think you want to see until it’s up there. I usually– look, I use the word jump very loosely. Yeah. These donkeys are falling off this high dive. But can’t put that on the sign. You know. Want to watch a donkey fall off a hi',\n",
       "  'gh dive? Like, no. What if he jumped? Well, at least he’s into it. [Laughter] Just so you know, PETA shut that down. That was one everybody was like, we get that one. There was another one they had to shut down, so this is also in the ’80s, pre-internet. You could fight an orangutan. You could fist-fight an orangutan. This was offered. We didn’t have a lot going on. This is what we had to do. So an orangutan would be in a boxing ring with boxing gloves on, and it would stand like this, and a guy would pay $5– it wasn’t for free. You would pay, and you would go in there and this orangutan would just knock this dude out because we didn’t have the internet to look up how strong is an orangutan, so… [laughter] …yeah. It was all word of',\n",
       "  ' mouth back then. You had to meet a guy that just fought an orangutan. And you’re like, are they strong? Yeah, dude. But the arms are skinny. I know. That’s what I thought as well. That strength comes from somewhere. Look, you think I’m old. There’s people older than me still around. Yeah. That’s crazy. It’s crazy. Walking around, people from the ’30s. My great aunt Helen, from the ’30s, she’s deaf. They didn’t know she was deaf until she was 9 years old. That’s how long it took for them to figure… deaf is one of the easier ones to figure out. And the doctors were baffled, as they smoked in her face. And they were like, I don’t know. She’s rude. I’ll tell you that. [Laughter] My mom– my parents are getting older, so we had my mom g',\n",
       "  'o pick up our daughter recently at a friend’s house. I texted her the address. She drove to the wrong house. She knocked on the door, and another grandmother answered. This is not good. This is like two dogs seeing each other through a fence. They’re gonna be there for a while, you know? So my mom, she knocks on the door. My mom goes, is my granddaughter in there, and that lady goes, I have three grandsons. So, no solution. Just two grandmothers just, do you have stuff? I have stuff too. They talked for 30 minutes. It’s a wrong door. I had to go get my daughter then find my mom. [Laughter] My dad too. My dad has surgery eight times a year probably. And he loves it. He loves it.

I go, I ain’t going to live like this. I didn’t work this hard not to do Afrin in my own home. So my dad goes to the doctor, and they were like, “do you use Afrin?” And he goes, “no.” And the doctor was like, like “I can see that you use it. I was just saying that.” [Laughter] And he goes, “how long have you been using it?,” and my dad said “five years,” which is a lie. But my mom was there, ',\n",
       "  'and she goes, “how about 45 years? That’s how long he’s used it.” The back of the box says no more than three days. [Laughter] There’s not a medicine on earth that tells you to give it a good 45-year run. That’s why I get nervous as I get older because I am already not smart. And I’m in my prime right now. I don’t read any books. I don’t do it. And I think that matters. I do think that matters. Reading, I believe, is the key to smart. That’s what I’ve always said. And I don’t do it because every book is just the most words. It doesn’t let up. I mean, every page is more words– it’s like, what are you talking about? Put some blank pages in there.

       " ['[dark music playing] [Neal] So if you’re watching this ’cause you saw my other Netflix specials and I talked about having depression and you wanted to support a fellow traveler, I have some terrible news. I feel pretty great. [audience cheering] It’s hard to know how to start these specials, so I’ve been trying to incorporate AI. [audience laughing] So… So every day, I go on that ChatGPT and I type in, “opening line for a comedy show.” Anyhow, tonight’s opening line is… “Good evening, pussies.” [audience laughing] Isn’t that weird? That’s a trillion dollars in deep learning. It’s every book ever published, every speech. That’s what they gave me. I was like, “Are you sure?” “Say it, pussy.” I was like, “Okay.” [audience laughing] So what kind of people are you? Are you crypto people? Yeah, I’m sitting crypto out, and maybe I’m blowing it. People go, “Where are you putting your money?” The bank. Shut up. [audience laughing] I’ve just… I’ve never rooted against a currency before, you know what I mean? I’ve never been like, “Fuck pesos!” I don’t… [audience laughing] My issue with crypto is everyone who told me about crypto had never spoken about finances before, ever. It’s like, “Weren’t you a DJ three weeks ago?” “Why are you telling me?” I was talking to my buddy. He’s like, “Bro, you’ll make sick returns.” I was like, “Never speak to me this way about money.” Social media makes everybody think they have to be cool. Certain people, I don’t want cool. I don’t want a cool finance guy, I don’t want a cool lawyer, I don’t want a cool doctor. I don’t want my doctor to be like, “Bro, I saw your X-rays.” “They were so sketch.” Like, I don’t want… [audience laughing] I have important things in my life. You know who I want in charge of ’em? Dorks. Here’s who I want in charge of my important things. Oily skin, bad clothing, no eye contact. Just a touch of Asperger’s. Just a touch. [audience laughing] Salt Bae, but it’s Asperger’s. [audience laughing] But I get why… why guys fell for crypto. And let’s be clear, it was all guys. [audience laughing] Women don’t take financial risks, women take emotional risks. Women will be like, “No, I didn’t invest in Bitcoin, but I am dating a drummer.” [audience laughing] “He’s basically separated.” [audience laughing] [scoffs] Yeah, the guys fell for crypto on social media, ’cause there are these dudes on the guys’ algorithm, uh, that are like hustle-preneurs. They’re all about grinding and hustling, and they’re, like, personal trainers. I call ’em “the clappers” ’cause they start all their posts like this. [claps] ‘Sup, guys? [audience laughing] Hey, if you’re under 30, I just have to let you know, no one’s ever clapped and said anything great in the history of the Earth. JFK wasn’t like… “Ask not what your country can do for you.” Martin Luther King wasn’t like… “I had a dream, my guy.” [audience laughing] “Please like and subscribe.” [audience laughing] “To hear more about my dreams, support my Patreon.” I was following one of these clapper dudes, right? I was hate-following. It doesn’t make a difference, but, uh… They all think they’re like werewolves. They’re like, “I guess I’m just built different.” Um… [audience laughing] They always have, like, this special system that doesn’t even make sense, where they’ll be like, “See, I got a millionaire mindset.” “I’ll let you in on something I’m doing. I just bought five used cars.” “I’m gassing them up myself, leasing them out to Uber drivers…” “I can’t lose money on this.” Then of course gas prices skyrocket. Next time I see the guy, he’s making a video from the gas station, “This system sucks.” Yeah, dumbass, ’cause ExxonMobil been on that… millionaire mindset… [audience laughing] …since 1881. So that’s… that’s guys’ social media. And then women’s social media, it’s just a lot of beautiful underdogs… [audience laughing] [scoffs] …that’s a part of something very dramatic. The entire world’s against them. They’ll be like, “When I began my journey…” They’re all on journeys. All of them are on journeys. They’re like, “When I began my journey, no one believed in me.” That’s what these girls don’t understand. It’s not that no one believes in you. No one gives a shit about anything anyone is doing but themselves. No one’s thinking about you, no one’s going to bed at night like, “You know who’ll never open a business? That bitch Jessica. Goodnight.” [snores] [audience laughing] Yeah. I’m on social media a lot, unfortunately. And I was dating a model. I was fo… I was following a model. And, uh… [audience laughing] Models love trying to normalize themselves. They’re',\n",
       "  ' like, “I know what it’s like to be a regular person, ’cause I went through an awkward phase in grade school.” So condescending. “I know what it’s like to be a regular person.” “I went through an awkward phase…” That’d be like me going up to an amputee and being like, “I know what you’re going through, pal, ’cause my foot falls asleep sometimes.” [audience laughing] “So I get it. Same-same, same-same, same-same.” Yeah, it’s all very pseudo-spiritual. A lot of talking about the ancestors. “We need to pray to the ancestors.” “We need to ask the ancestors for guidance.” If you’re Black, or Brown, or Indigenous, go ahead and pray to your ancestors. White people, do not pray to your ancestors under any circumstances. [audience laughing] All of my ancestors were toothless, Irish, illiterate alcoholic maniacs from a very different time who I cannot rely on for any guidance whatsoever. I could say, “I’m having a hard time with my girlfriend. What do I do?” Just be like, “Lock her in the shed!” [audience laughing] “Push her off a cliff and blame it on the wind.” [audience laughing] “It works every time.” “Boy-o.” Yeah, they love talking about the ancestors on the girls’ algorithm. And you know what word they love using? The T-word. [woman] Ugh. You know… Oh, she gets it. [audience laughing] You know what T-word I’m talking about. Trauma… [audience laughing] Aaah… I know you may be thinking, “Neal, it’s hypocritical of you to criticize women talking about trauma in public.” Yeah, good point. But when I talk about trauma, it’s different. It’s on Netflix, goddamn it. [audience laughing] Yeah, but again, some of these girls are full of shit. You know they are. This can’t all be trauma. Everything’s trauma to them. They’ll be like, “I had so much trauma today at Starbucks.” “I was literally shaking.” Well, you’re addicted to Adderall, so that checks out. [audience laughing] Also, ladies, if you can talk about it on social media, probably not trauma! Just letting you know. Trauma’s a physical thing. Physical thing. Not a vibe, a physical thing that happened to you that’s so jarring to your body and spirit that you don’t know how to process it, let alone post about it on social media with captions and music. [audience laughing] Like, a good example of trauma would be, uh… World War II. [audience laughing] Our great-grandfathers fought in World War II, never mentioned it once. They didn’t come back and be like, “So I was just in Germany.” [audience laughing] “It was not okay.” [audience laughing] “I stormed the beaches at Normandy, I literally died.” [audience laughing] “You guys, turns out, one of my triggers?” “Triggers.” [audience laughing] “Also, can I just say, kind of a controversial opinion, but Hitler? Toxic.” [audience laughing] It’s surprising, ’cause I did not see the trauma flexing coming. What’s even more surprising to me is that the culture of social media spread to people that aren’t even on it. I was talking to my buddy, he said, “You need to focus on gratitude.” I was like, “Goodbye.” [audience laughing] Another buddy was like, “You need to check your entitlement.” I was like, “I’m gonna call you right back.” You’re blocked forever. I’m not talking like this. I’m not doing this with my friends. He goes, “That’s what friends are for.” I was like, “No, that’s what grandparents are for.” I was talking to somebody today, and she’s like, “I think my kids are dumb, ’cause my husband’s dumb.” I was like, “Now, this is a friendship right here.” [audience laughing] You’re not really friends with somebody unless you’re both worried that if your text messages went public, you’d both lose your jobs. That is a friendship, and you cherish it and you nurture it, and you should encrypt it, probably. [audience laughing] By the way, don’t get me wrong. I’m not one of those people who’s like, “This country’s going to hell in a handbasket.” “Things used to be better.” No, a lot of stuff is better now than it was before. My brothers and sisters, I’m the youngest of ten, they would always bring up TV ratings as like a barometer of how well the country was doing. They’d be like, “You know, 50 million people used to watch <i>Cheers</i> or <i>M*A*S*H</i> or <i>All in the Family.”</i> Yet the reason 50 million people watched <i>All in the Family</i> is ’cause there was nothing else to do. You’d either watch <i>All In the Family</i> or go stand in the yard. There was nothing you could do. [audience laughing] Also, TV used… Are you out of your mind? TV’s never been better. It never will be better. Like, you know it’s good TV because we binge-watch. That’s l',\n",
       "  'ike a junkie word, you know what I mean? I didn’t even realize I was a binger till fairly recently. Like, I was watching <i>Stranger Things</i> and I’d watch, like, a bunch of episodes in a row, and then after the third one, like, that little pop-up window came on. Like “New episode in five, four, three…” And I was like, “Let’s go! I don’t have that kind of time.” “Let’s go, motherfucker!” [audience laughing] Skip intro! I don’t fucking need a recap. I just watched three episodes! Dude, you know who the fuck I am! [audience laughing] Things are better. We can solve murders now. They used to not be able to… All they had was just the fingerprint dust and they were stumped. All you had to do was wear gloves and you could murder three or four nights a week, if you wanted to. Here’s how easy it was to murder. Murderers used to write letters to the newspaper for fun! [audience laughing] Like, “Dear Paper, it’s me, the murderer.” “Things are getting a little boring, so here’s a clue.” “What has four legs and loves dinner? A table. See you at the next murder.” [audience laughing] And they’d still get away with it! The Zodiac wrote a dozen letters to the paper, and they were just like, “This guy is some kind of mastermind.” “He must have worn mittens or something. I don’t know how he’s doing this.” Things are better now. People over 40, back me up on this. Back me up on how sloppy and disorganized the world used to be. Remember when sunblock began? [audience laughing] Young people, there was no sunblock. There was suntan oil, and then the next week, they were like, “Hey, that was lube for cancer.” [audience laughing] “Block your whole thing.” White people were getting scorched, is my point. We were getting scorched. As a white person, you’d go outside. It was time to come back in when you were like, “Do you smell meat?” It was you. [audience laughing] And you know who doesn’t care? My Black friends. I try to tell my Black friends. I’m like, “Dude, I’ve gotten second-degree, bubbly burns.” White people get skin cancer 30 times more than Black people. My Black friends are like, “Neal, I’m having a hard time finding my passion for this.” [audience laughing] You know what I’m starting to realize? This is going to sound crazy. But if you think about it, the sun is basically the cops for white people. [audience laughing] Think about it. Following us around everywhere we go, fucking with us ’cause of the color of our skin, killing our cousins for no reason. And when I tell my Black friends the sun killed my cousin, they’re like, “What was he wearing?” I’m like, “Goddamn!” [applause and laughter] [Neal] Things are better. Depression and anxiety are worse, I’ll say that. And, uh, people blame social media, or at least try to. I don’t blame social media for anxiety and depression. You know what I blame? Documentaries. [audience laughing] Yeah, there’s too… We used to not know anything. It was great. Once documentaries came out, we started knowing shit, our lives got worse. Before documentaries, we’d say shit like, “Yeah, the whale wants to be at SeaWorld. Yeah!” [audience laughing] The five scariest words in the English language are, “Did you see that documentary?” [audience laughing] Whatever you’re doing is about to be ruined. I was eating with chopsticks. My buddy’s like, “Did you see the chopsticks documentary?” I’m like, “Why? Are they bad for the environment?” “Worse than we thought, pandas are using them to stab each other.” I’m like, “Goddamn it.” Gotta be careful which ones you watch. I’m vegan ’cause I watched the wrong goddamn documentary. A buddy of mine sent me a trailer, like, “You gotta watch this.” I go, “What’s it about?” He goes, “It’s a documentary about how all toothpaste is toxic.” Like, “Fuck that. I’m not watching that.” [audience laughing] I just spent $180 at Costco to get enough toothpaste to last five generations of my family. I’m not throwing it away ’cause some dickhead’s like, “My toothpaste journey will shock you.” [audience laughing] I was watching a documentary recently about advertising. Do you know that they can’t advertise religion in a lot of countries? I don’t know, we’re saturated in them. I don’t think they work. I’ve never been like, “Latter-day Saints, tell me more.” Like… I don’t think they <i>couldn’t</i> work. I just think they don’t work as currently constructed. All right, here’s how I think they should make religious commercials that’d work. You know those… those, uh, political campaign attack ads, right? During election season, there’ll be those commercials, it’s like black-and-white footage and an o',\n",
       "  'minous voice-over. Like, “Steve Jones is a total piece of shit.” [audience laughing] But for LA, last election for mayor, it got insane. They were like, “Rick Caruso wants to make homeless people sex workers.” “What?!” [audience laughing] “I’m listening, go on.” [audience laughing] Here’s what I think they should do. I think that’s what religions should do. Make attack ads on each other for like a month, and then we vote. [audience laughing] And again, this is… We’re not in the best, you know, climate for religious stuff, but I think we can… we can get through this joke. [audience laughing] You know what I mean? Week one, Jewish people make an attack ad on Christians. Wait for it. [in upbeat voice] Christianity only has two holidays a year. Judaism has tons of holidays. Sometimes we make them up the day before. If anyone questions us, we’ll just say they’re being anti-Semitic. [audience laughing] Plus, the god at the center of Christianity, Jesus Christ, was Jewish! Why pray to a Jew when you can be one? [audience laughing] This message was paid for by Judaism but honestly we didn’t pay, because we run the network. [audience laughing] [audience clapping] It’s not a huge applause break, but you know. [audience laughing] [chuckles] Also, if you’re mad that Jewish people run TV networks, they invented them. They started the movie business, then the radio business, then the TV business. It’s kinda theirs to run. That would be like complaining, “The Italians run salami!” [audience laughing] Week two… Catholics make an attack ad on Muslims. Hear me out. I wrote this joke three months ago, different world. [audience laughing] [chuckles] [in upbeat voice] Muslims have to pray five times a day. Catholics only have to pray when it’s super important. [audience laughing] Like when they take an STD test. [audience laughing] Plus, Muslims make women wear burkas that cover up their whole bodies. Catholicism would never do that. We teach women shame the old-fashioned way, psychologically. [audience laughing] Plus, Islam forbids alcohol. Catholicism serves that shit at mass. Catholicism, we’ll bring a little booze, you bring the little boys. [audience laughing] [chuckles] [chuckling] Here we go. Yeah. Atheism could win, right? The election. A lot of atheists here, right? Like, you know, I used to be an atheist, and then I kept drinking ayahuasca, and that changed. God came and got me. Uh… I could make a hot-ass atheism commercial. I just need like 15 seconds. Black screen, white type. You’re liberal. You’re vegan. You recycle. You believe in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Come on! You already think you’re better than everyone. Finish the job! Atheism. [audience laughing] Speaking of religion, did you see the Dalai Lama got in trouble a few months ago? If you don’t know the story, the Dalai Lama, like, made out with, like, an eight-year-old. I didn’t know he was Catholic. Did you know he was Catholic? [audience laughing] People get upset when an important religious figure falls like that. I didn’t feel upset at all. I felt, like, liberated. I feel like if the Dalai Lama’s a pedophile, we can probably litter. You know what I mean? [audience laughing] But I get why people are upset about the Dalai Lama. People need leaders, and a lot of leaders are just worse than they’ve ever been. You know, religious leaders are bad, corporate leaders are bad, political leaders seem pretty bad. Doesn’t 91 indictments seem like a lot? Just hypothetically. Trump got found guilty of sexual assault. Basically rape. We’re all so numb to it that we’re just like, “Put it on our tab.” “We don’t understand what’s happening to our country.” I’ve totally accepted that Trump may still win, right? Totally accepted. As far as I’m concerned, the next president is either gonna be Trump from prison or Biden from hospice. That’s just what it’s gonna be. He’s found guilty of rape, basically. Isn’t that insane? And I know rape’s a tough thing to bring up at a comedy show. It’s like the Holocaust or slavery. If you bring it up, do you trivialize it in a bad way, or do you reduce it in a good way? Let’s try to reduce rape in a good way. Ready? I think we can do it. We never joke about rape ’cause it’s the worst thing you can do to somebody except murder, and we joke about murder constantly. Dude, if you come to my show and sit in the front row with your girl, I’m gonna kill you. If you wear a beanie to my show, I’m gonna murder you on sight. I couldn’t have substituted “rape” in either one of those. [audience laughing] Your dad is never gonna call you and be like, “If you’re late fo',\n",
       "  'r Mom’s birthday, I’m gonna rape you.” It’s never gonna happen. [audience laughing] Every movie’s got kill, death, murder in the title, in the plot. You’re never going to see a trailer for <i>John Wick 5,</i> like, “They raped his dog.” [audience laughing] “And now one by one, he has to rape them back.” I loved <i>Kill Bill.</i> Did anybody see <i>Rape Bill?</i> I don’t remember. James Bond, <i>License to Rape.</i> Who was that? Was that Daniel Craig? Remember that great song “Raping Them Softly”? My friend said I probably shouldn’t do that joke. Eh. I was like, “How come?” She goes, “‘Cause I think rape is worse than murder.” I was like, “I know a lot of people that are recovering from rape.” “I don’t know anyone who’s recovered from murder.” All right, one guy, 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ, and people will not shut the fuck up about it. He was dead, then he was like, “Psych! Look familiar, motherfucker? Yeah!” “Should have raped me.” [audience laughing] Look, I probably shouldn’t do that joke, but unfortunately, it rapes. [audience laughing and clapping] I may have lost you on that. That’s a new thing where, because so many political and religious and corporate leaders and journalists have all sort of fallen, so now, comedians are held to this incredibly high standard. It’s so weird. It’s so weird! Like, remember when everybody was walking around going, “Is Ellen nice?” Is Ellen DeGeneres nice? Ellen’s one of the funniest people alive. That’s A. B, she’s a gay rights icon. Came out on TV in the ’90s, got kicked off TV for being gay, comes back six years later, dominates. It’s an amazing story, but it’s not enough for people. They’re like, “Yeah, but is she nice?” It’s so childish. It’s like being like, “Is my car also a boat?” Just appreciate that you have a car, you baby. Also, “Is Ellen nice?” How many nice lesbians have you ever met in your entire life? [audience laughing] They’re never mean, but they’re never bubbly. They’re like public defenders. Like, “We’re going to get you out of here.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] I had a handyman doing work at my house. Not like he was “my handyman,” I got him off Craigslist, and he just wasn’t that handy. After a few times coming to my house, he was like, “You know Kevin Hart?” I was like, “I know Kevin a little bit.” He goes, “Is he humble?” [audience laughing] I was like, “Jeremy, you’re a handyman, you’re not humble.” [audience laughing] Why does Kevin have to be? What you’re asking is, “Hey, Neal, is that 5’3″ billionaire humble?” “What do you think, Jeremy?” How humble do you think Kevin Hart is on a scale from Napoleon to Tom Cruise? [audience laughing] “Where do you put little Kevin there in terms of raw humility?” Comedians get in trouble all the time for talking about transgender rights. How corrupt is the rest of society that we’re talking about a serious issue, people go, “What do the clowns think?” Why are you bringing this up? “Has anyone asked the clowns about it?” [audience laughing] I will say, I have a pretty controversial, uh, transgender opinion. You ready? I don’t think about them that much. [audience laughing] [man hooting] “Neal, are you a bigot?” Nope, just busy. [audience laughing] I think about transgender people about as much as I think about left-handed Filipino people. [audience laughing] I’m not mad at them. I hope they get everything they need. If I meet one and they want to shake with their left hand, I won’t say, “Right hands only! I don’t recognize that hand as a hand.” [audience laughing] Joe Rogan gets in trouble all the time. Joe Rogan, known him 30 years. Great dude, nice dude, funny dude, always been nice to me. He got in trouble during COVID because he had on anti-vax people, and when you’re talking in public about medicine and science, you should hit them back with facts, whereas Joe was just like, [in dizzy voice] “That’s interesting.” Um… He got in trouble and then people were boycotting Spotify, and then Spotify didn’t promote him or demote him. They were just like, “Ah…” That was their official corporate statement. Like, “Ah…” Be funny if a corporation really stood by one of their controversial artists or spokesmen, like, uh… Like when Jared from Subway… [audience laughing] …got popped. You know what I mean? If Subway’d been like, “Yeah, he’s a pedophile but he lost the fucking weight.” [audience laughing] “We don’t know how he burned calories, that’s none of our business.” [audience laughing in disbelief] [scoffs] I’m a bad boy. [audience laughing] [scoffs] The problem with Joe’s podcast is it’s too long. The worst I’ve ever had to piss',\n",
       "  ' is every time I’ve done that podcast. Like, it’s amazing. It’s just insanely long. Of course he’s gonna say stuff incorrectly once in a while. You ever drive, like, a fouror five-hour drive, like Vegas? And by the third hour, you’re just grasping at straws. Like, “Would you have sex with Judge Judy? Be honest.” [audience laughing] “Like, for charity?” [audience laughing] I gotta say, it’s a weird time to be a comedian. Every time I pick my phone up, it’s like your friend’s in trouble. Like, “Did Joe Rogan abdicate his responsibility as a broadcaster?” “Did Dave Chappelle bring the tackling on himself with transgender talk?” I don’t know. This shit’s all so heavy. Like, I didn’t get into comedy to make grand moral judgments about my friends. Got into comedy to jerk off in front of unsuspecting women. [audience laughing] Now are you going to support me or not? [short-lived laughter] Did everyone get that one? [audience laughing] Another issue is, Joe just kept getting more and more mainstream. Like, if you had asked me in the year 2004 who the most consequential political figures in America would be in 2024, I would not have said the host of <i>The Apprentice</i> and the host of <i>Fear Factor.</i> Would not have said it. [audience laughing] But everything gets more mainstream. Mental health got way more mainstream. Very few people used to talk about it, and now it’s a true movement. ESPN’s always carrying on about how athletes need to have good mental health. And I want everyone to have great mental health. But, um… but not athletes. [audience laughing] Guys, we need our athletes to be total psychos. You don’t understand that? You know what I call an athlete with good mental health? An assistant coach is what I call them. [audience laughing] What documentary did we all watch about basketball during COVID? <i>Last Dance,</i> correct. Did Michael Jordan seem mentally healthy to you in the slightest? Giant mansion, one chair. [audience laughing] Here’s what we learned during <i>The Last Dance.</i> We learned that Michael Jordan’s hobby was basketball, but his passion was revenge. [audience laughing] It’s what fueled him. It’s what fuels all the greats. Settling scores and holding grudges. I was at a restaurant recently, and some little kid was crying. His dad was like, “Son, remember, the most important thing in life is to never take anything personally.” I slid in and said, “Unless you want to be the greatest basketball player ever.” [audience laughing] “So do you want to make $150 million every year in passive income off a picture of you jumping from 1985, and even just based on the silhouette of you jumping, we can tell what an absolute sociopath you are, and we want that shit on our shirt and our shoes, and Mexican dudes want it on the back of their pickup trucks for some reason.” [audience laughing] No one knows why. Right side of the glass, white Jordan logo. Let the anthropologists figure it out, guys. No one knows. Yeah, if they’re great at sports, they’re out of their minds. Tom Brady, not well. [audience laughing] Did you see him try to play toward the end? Whenever he’d try to run, he looked like he was on the toilet and he left his phone in the other room. [audience laughing] Tom Brady tried to retire, made it like ten days. Finally, he was like… [in raspy voice] “I don’t know these fucking kids.” [audience laughing] They were like, “Dad, come outside and throw the ball?” He was like, “With you guys? No.” [audience laughing] The greatest athlete in any sport is the craziest. Michael Phelps. Michael Phelps has 23 gold medals in the Olympics. You know what second place of all time is? Eight. He should be in a padded cell. He’s always been pretty open about having depression, right? Which didn’t surprise me at all ’cause when he first came back from the Olympics, he had, like, a few gold medals, and then someone took a picture of him smoking weed, and then he got busted for a DUI. People were like, “I’m worried about Phelps.” I was like, “I’m not. This maniac’s right on time.” [audience laughing] “That’s just a boy who loves his country.” [audience laughing] By the way, it’s not just male athletes. It’s female too. Like those little gymnastics girls? That shit should be against the law. The events are insane! It’s like, “All right, you’re going to come charging down this runway, you have bare feet, and then wear, like, a bathing suit with, like, bedazzled.” “And, uh… And then you’re going to get to the end of the runway.” “We put a trampoline down there, right?” “And then someone left a table. So, you gotta…” “By the way, y',\n",
       "  'ou’re 11, right?” [audience laughing] “You better stick the landing, you little bitch.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] They don’t even sound like sporting events. They sound like <i>Jackass</i> stunts that they let them practice in advance. Like, “I’m Johnny Knoxville. This is a balance beam.” [vocalizes] Do those figure skater girls look like they’re having a good time? Not to me. They look like they’re struggling, right? Whenever they do those figure skating events, it looks like it’s the first day the girls have been allowed to wear makeup, and they have no idea what they’re doing. Where they’re like, “Okay, doll, doll, doll.” “Doll, doll, doll.” “Shock, horror.” [audience laughing] And the events, again, are insane. They’re spinning, and then they start spinning so fast that they turn into a hologram of themselves. Like… [audience laughing] They have to stick the landing and act like they didn’t just travel through time. [audience laughing] And then they finish, and they have to go sit in the booth with their kidnappers. Where they… [audience laughing] Holding flowers that someone picked up from the freeway. “I go now? Yes, I’m free to go?” Last Olympics, I… I just called the FBI. Like, “Are you missing any girls?” “‘Cause they’re ice skating.” The best athlete is generally the craziest athlete. Kyrie Irving. One of the best guards ever, right? And then about five years ago, he said the Earth was flat. Then he wouldn’t take the vaccine, so he couldn’t play, and then he promoted an anti-Semitic video. Like, “I knew he was good. I didn’t know he was this good! My God.” [audience laughing] “This kid’s fucking around with GOAT status. Shit.” Every sport, the best person in it is the craziest. Oscar Pistorius. Remember Oscar Pistorius? Paralympian. Then someone said, “Can you believe Oscar Pistorius murdered his girlfriend?” I was like, “He’s a sprinter with no legs.” [audience laughing] “I believe he can do anything.” [audience laughing] Dennis Rodman. One of the greatest rebounders, then he retired. Someone’s like, “You want to be friends with Kim Jong-un?” He’s like, “You know I do.” [audience laughing] Lance Armstrong. I don’t even consider Lance Armstrong an athlete. I consider Lance Armstrong a criminal who found a bike. [audience laughing] Imagine the worst lie you’ve ever told, now imagine selling bracelets about it. [audience laughing] Respect, sir. Respect. And then of course the biggest maniac any of us have ever seen in our entire lives, Tiger Woods. Did you see that documentary? It was called <i>Tiger,</i> but they should have called it <i>Golfin’ and Fuckin’.</i> [audience laughing] ‘Cause that’s all that kid was doing was golfin’ and fuckin’, golfin’ and fuckin’. They caught him fuckin’ and were like, “You gotta stop fucking.” He’s like, “All right, but I’m pretty sure I’m going to be worse at golf.” [audience laughing] And he was! [audience laughing] He knew the formula. It’s golfin’ and fuckin’. It’s not golfin’ and raising a family. Ugh! Ugh! Literally, ugh! I knew Tiger was a real one. Twenty years ago, I saw him at some event. And he’s walking along with bodyguards. Not big bodyguards either. Not burly dudes, like little white dudes with black turtlenecks on, like real… real dangerous people. So they’re walking along, and some little British guy comes running out from nowhere, and he goes, “Tiger!” And, uh, the security guards just immediately put the clamps on him. This is how I knew Tiger was a real one, ’cause the guy went, “Tiger, help.” [audience laughing] Tiger didn’t even break stride. He was like, “That’s neither golfing nor fucking.” [audience laughing] “So I should keep it moving.” Do your best with the mental health stuff. Therapy, medication, whatever. Just know that if you don’t get there, some of the greatest things that have ever happened on Earth were created by psychopaths and drug addicts. Like every invention, psychopaths and drug addicts. Like Sigmund Freud, the guy invented therapy, right? Open cokehead. Would write about it in his books. Most of Freud’s books should be called <i>This May Be the Cocaine Talking.</i> Like… [audience laughing] They’re insanely cokey ideas. You can hear it. Like… [sniffs] “Okay. What else?” Uh… [audience laughing] “Okay, come on, what are we doing? I… think women are jealous of our dicks.” “Yeah, they are. That’s good. Yep, yep, yep!” [knocking] “Yep, yep, yep, yep.” “What else? What else? Uh… I think every guy wants to fuck his mom.” “Oh, yeah, he does.” “That might be the hottest shit you ever wrote, boy.” [audience laughing] Listen to me. No cocaine, no the',\n",
       "  'rapy. The guy popularized therapy because of coke! And it makes sense, ’cause therapy is an extremely cokey idea. Like, “Just come into the office and fucking just tell me everything.” “Tell me about your mom and your dad and your dreams at night.” After an hour, he’s like, “Hey, get the fuck outta here!” [audience laughing] [whooping] [inaudible] “Come back in exactly a week.” [audience laughing] I’m telling you, psychopaths and drug addicts. Thomas Edison did coke. The Wright brothers worked in a bike shop. I don’t know about you, but anyone I’ve ever met who worked in a bike shop could get me meth <i>today.</i> [audience laughing] I don’t know if they really did meth, but I will say they had the methiest idea ever, like, “Hey, do you fucking feel like you can fly?” And they go, “Meet me at the beach.” [mimics airplane engine] Psychopaths and drug addicts, even the… even the modern inventors. Elon Musk. People don’t like Elon Musk. The guy founded PayPal and Tesla. People are like, “But he’s a troll and a bad dad.” I’m like, “So is mine. He did nothing to fight climate change.” [audience laughing] Also, have you been in a Tesla? Have you been in a Tesla? My buddy let me drive his Tesla. I laughed out loud at how fast it went. Been clinically depressed my entire life, on dozens of medications. In a Tesla for 13 seconds, cured forever. [audience laughing] He’s another one who I knew he was a real one, a long time ago. He came to the Comedy Store one night, right? And, uh… there was… You know, room shaped like this. He sat in the corner, never faced the stage once. Live your life, you fucking maniac. Just getting his Amadeus on in the corner, like, “Aah.” Fantastic. Just a touch of Asperger’s, guys. Just a touch. [audience laughing] Bill Gates got caught cheating on his wife via email. [audience laughing] Dude, you invented email! [audience laughing] Psychopaths and drug addicts. Most culture is from psychopaths and drug addicts. Music, there’s a zillion stories from rock and roll about drugs, right? I read Keith Richards’ autobiography. This is how drugged out they were. So the Stones had so many drug charges, that in order to tour in America, they had to hire a doctor to travel with them and test them for drugs every day. The doctor lasted six weeks before, you guessed it, he got hooked on cocaine. Whoops! [audience laughing] The vampire hunter got bit. [audience laughing] Rock’s insane like that, psychopaths and drug addicts. Hip-hop. [makes parrot-like sound] [audience laughing] [parrot-like sound] You ever know a not-fucked-up person make either one of those noises? You ever call your mom, like, “Happy Sunday, Mom.” She’s like… [makes parrot-like sound] [audience laughing] Snoop Dogg, one of the greatest entertainers of all time, a hip-hop legend, and he’s so fucked up, that at a certain point, he just started talking in fizzle-jizzle language. We all accepted it. Like, “Should we get him to hospital?” “No, let’s go to the studio. See what he can do.” [audience laughing] Snoop may have no idea what’s happening. Like, “Fizzle jizzle wizzle bizzle.” “Bow wow wow, fizzle jizzle bizzle wizzle.” “Skechers, I’d love to endorse Skechers. Bow wow wow fizzle.” “Martha Stewart! I should do several shows with her.” Meanwhile, he thinks it’s <i>Ellen.</i> He’s gone. [audience laughing] Kendrick Lamar. True genius, right? Sing along if you know the words where he says… <i>♪ If Pirus and Crips all got along ♪</i> <i>♪ They’d probably gun me down By the end of this song ♪</i> <i>♪ Feels like the whole city go against me Every time I’m in the street, I hear… ♪</i> <i>♪ Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk ♪</i> <i>♪ Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk ♪</i> You can’t get to<i>, “</i>Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk” sober. You cannot get there, guys. You could be in a marina, walk past four yachts, and you’re not gonna think, “Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk.” [audience laughing] And he has a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize. [audience laughing] [parrot-like sound] You may be thinking, “Neal, psychopaths and drug addicts?” “Are all comedians psychopaths and drug addicts?” So far, yep. [audience laughing] Let’s go down the list. George Carlin, drug addict. Richard Pryor, drug addict. Bill Cosby, choose-your-own-adventure. [audience laughing] Lenny Bruce, drug addict. Mitch Hedberg, drug addict. John Belushi, drug addict. John Mulaney told me to remind you he’s a drug addict. [audience laughing] Those are just the drug addicts that you know about. Then there’s the alcoholics we don’t have time for. So let’s do mental illness. Mark Twain, bipolar. Taylor Tomlinson, bipolar too. I’m depressed, ',\n",
       "  'Sarah’s depressed. Rodney Dangerfield was depressed. Joan Rivers was depressed. Howie Mandel has the worst case of OCD I’ve ever heard of. Chris Rock’s got nonverbal learning disability. Jim Jefferies… Um… [audience laughing and whooping] I don’t know what Bill Burr’s issue is, but he’s yelled at me every time I’ve seen him for 20 years straight. [audience laughing] It’s ’cause people that are good at something are optimized for that thing, and pretty much nothing else, right? You ever play a video game where you make the character and you have 100 points, and you gotta distribute it between dexterity and marksmanship and speed? That’s what God does, and sometimes he fucks up. Like when God was making Woody Allen… [audience] Whoa… …they were like, “God, how many points should we give him for comedy and filmmaking?” God’s like, “Fuck it, give him 100.” They were like, “That doesn’t leave any points for not fucking his family.” [audience laughing] And God was like, “How bad can it be?” Then 70 years later, an angel was like, “Did you see that documentary?” God was like, “Fuck!” [audience laughing] [audience cheering] Yeah, like I’m good at this, and I’m not good at relationships. And I just realized why. I just realized why, like, recently. I’m not that good at relationships ’cause I’m preoccupied with this! I’ll be in a relationship with a woman, we’ll be having, like, normal relationship conversations. She’s being like, “Hey, I think this weekend we should go see my mom.” I’m like, “Religions should make attack ads on each other.” She’s like, “After that, we can go antiquing.” I’m like, “The sun is like the cops for white people.” She’ll say, “You’re not listening.” “Of course I’m listening.” “Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk.” Also, have you been in a relationship? They’re very difficult. Who’s in their twenties, by round of applause? [audience clapping] All right, so let me explain to you how your dating life’s gonna go. So you’re in your twenties, and you’re gonna start dating seriously, and you’re going to realize, like, “Oh, I have emotional problems.” In your thirties, you’re gonna be like, “I’m gonna solve my emotional problems.” In your forties, you’re gonna be like, “It’s a shame I never did solve… [audience laughing] …those emotional problems.” Don’t you wish we had more in common, men and women? I like those couples with one thing in common, and they’re seeing how far they can take it. Know what I mean? Like going into Comic-Con dressed as his-and-her orcs. I like the weightlifting couple walking around like spray-tanned apes everywhere they go. Like, “Come on, babe.” “Let’s go home and talk about chicken breast and broccoli again.” I want us to have more in common, I really do. Sometimes I’ll be on dating apps and I’ll cover up women’s photos to see what their personality’s like. One girl’s bio, recently, was like, “I love SoulCycle and red wine and sunsets and rockin’ playlists.” And I thought, “If this was a guy, I would run him over with my car.” [audience laughing] Then I see it’s a beautiful woman, I’m like, “She may be the one.” [audience laughing] It’s just hard. Relationships are just hard. Maybe it’s me. Maybe I’m too preoccupied with this and it makes me petty. Let’s see. Uh, so I was in love with a woman and, uh, we were together for a while. We were in love, it was amazing. She had a trip planned to Singapore, and then Putin invades Ukraine. My girl calls me. “I’m really afraid this will affect my trip to Singapore.” And I was like, “It’s not gonna.” She was like, “No, everyone in Malibu is saying it’s gonna affect it.” I was like, “Babe, I think living near the beach like slows down your brain or something.” “Unless your flight is connecting through Kiev, like, I think you’re straight.” She was like, “I have to get off the phone now.” I go, “Why?” She goes, “Because you’re not supporting my fear.” Like, “I’ve never even heard of that.” She’s like, “I need you to support my fear.” I was like, “Okay, from here on out, I’ll try to support your fear.” So anyway, about eight days later, we’re in bed, and there’s a noise downstairs. My girl looks at me and goes, “I’m scared.” And I looked at her and I said, “You should be.” [audience laughing] “‘Cause he sounds big, and I bet he doesn’t want to have sex with me at all.” [audience laughing] “Do you feel the support? There’s so much support.” [chuckles] There’s just a lot of obstacles to relationships. Like, we can’t talk directly about sex. We can’t be like, “Sex? Sex? Sex?” You just have to get together and hint at it for like six hours. You’re just like… [giggles malici',\n",
       "  'ously] “I just like paying for stuff. I don’t know what it is.” [giggles] [audience laughing] It’s so dumb that we can’t talk about the most important thing to our species. If I’m with my buddy and I want to eat, I go, “Hey, you want to go to lunch?” I don’t take a spoon out of my pocket and be like… [audience laughing] “What’s it remind you of?” [audience laughing] And then we have sex, and we understand that your orgasms are a little nonlinear, right? But fellas, I’ve… I’ve figured something out about women. Trying to make a woman have an orgasm is like ordering an Uber, right? ‘Cause you open the app, and you hit the button, and you go, “All right, it’s coming in seven minutes.” [audience laughing] A couple minutes pass, “Great, it’s coming in two minutes.” “I can see the little car. That’s good.” Some more time passes, you’re like, “It’s coming in five minutes?” [audience laughing] “Why is that car spinning around like that?” [audience laughing] “Wait a minute. Ride canceled?” [audience laughing] “I hope this doesn’t affect my rating.” [audience laughing] But it will. [chuckles] Yeah. I don’t want to complain about women’s orgasms. I mean, women are so empathetic, it’s incredible. It’s incredible. Like, women are so empathetic that they’ll be empathetic when we’re orgasming. Like, guys’ll be having our, like, “Don’t tase me, bro.” [audience laughing] “I’m not resisting,” like… And women are so empathetic that they’ll shake along with us. Where they’re like, “I don’t want you to be alone during your time of seizure.” [audience laughing] Whereas I’m the total opposite. If a woman’s on top having an orgasm, I’m like, “Neal, don’t you fucking move a muscle.” [audience laughing] Like there’s a grizzly bear in the room. “Don’t even make eye contact.” “Let her take what she needs to take.” [audience laughing] It’s my… my turn? “Aah…” [audience laughing] [chuckles] All right, we gotta get out of here. Think of the best sex compliment you’ve ever gotten. I’m pretty sure I can beat it. This is the best compliment I’ve ever gotten about anything, just FYI. A woman said, “Neal, you fuck like you’re poor.” [audience laughing and clapping] The problem was, after that, whenever she would text me to come over, I’d have to get in, like, a poor mindset. So I’d, like, take the bus to her house. I’d do scratch-offs the whole way there. Calling my friends on Cricket Wireless. You get it. I’d also like to say it’s sex, so I’m not consistent, right? Sometimes I fuck like I’m poor, and other times, I fuck like my grandfather left me quite a bit of money. [audience laughing] [chuckles] That’s… And I also I get another sex compliment. And ladies, let’s turn this into a teaching opportunity. A woman said, “Neal, you know what’s great about you?” “When I tell you I’m gonna have an orgasm, you keep on doing what you were doing.” [women cheering and applauding] A lot of the guys have no idea why you’re applauding. [audience laughing] Fellas, keep on doing what you were doing. Same angle, same rhythm, same force. [women cheering] Keep on doing what you were doing. Same angle, same rhythm, same force. Women will say, “I’m gonna have an orgasm,” and the guy will say, “Now’s a good time for the corkscrew.” Dummy! [audience laughing] Keep on doing what you were doing! Same angle, same rhythm, same force. “Neal, how am I gonna remember that?” ARF. [audience laughing] Do you guys want to fuck poor or not? [audience laughing] ‘Sup, guys. Want to learn how to fuck poor? [audience laughing] All right, I gotta go. Thank you so much, you guys. [closing music playing] [audience cheering] Your email address will not be published.

       " ['[audience cheering and applauding] Hello! Hello! [cheering and applause continue] Thank you. Thank you guys so much. Minneapolis! Look at you. Thank you. Wonderful. I’m so happy to be here. Hello, hello, hi. [audience chuckles] Happy New Year. [audience laughing] I know what month it is. [audience laughing] I know that’s a confusing thing to hear outside of January, but I love saying “Happy New Year.” I go year-round. I bring my Happy New Years year-round, ’cause everybody loves it. Happy New Year. Just feels good to say. Doesn’t matter where you’re from, your religion, your country. Everybody celebrates it. It’s not like “Merry Christmas.” “Merry Christmas” can go either way, and I hate to offend people. So this whole last holiday season, I didn’t let out one “Merry Christmas.” That’s true. Instead, I said, “May the birth of the one and only true God…” [audience laughing] “…Jesus Christ, bestow a blessing of grace and peace upon your household… to the belittlement of every other false religion… lest you be gay.” That’s what I say. [audience laughing] Oh, Minneapolis, thank you for laughing at that in the correct way. [audience cheering] Yes. Irony. I’ve done that joke in the Deep South. Different vibe. [audience laughing] There’s no humor. They’re just like, “Fuck yeah!” “Somebody said it!” “Lest you be gay!” I’m like, “No, no, no. No, no, no.” I don’t like New Years. Anyone else? I won’t make fun of you. [audience cheering] Yeah. You know, I could tell by the cologne content of the room that this wasn’t a big New Years crowd. It’s a huge holiday for the cologne community. I don’t care for it. It’s a jacked-up, wraparound-Oakleys, dumb-fuck holiday, and it sucks. I hate it. What are we doing out there, cuddled up in the cold, like, “Ten! Nine!” Just watching the odometer on the truck of the Earth roll over to zero. You know it’s been a year since it was today too, right? [audience laughing] It’s been exactly one year since it was today. Nobody’s excited. They’re just like, “No, only January 1. That’s the only one that excites me.” “Something about one and one next to each other gets me rock hard.” “Yeah!” And, like, whenever I see us out there being like, “Five! Four!” I’m like, we deserve everything the shadow government is doing to us. [audience laughing] We deserve all their tricks. We deserve chem trails, fluoride in the water, rigged elections… ‘Cause we’re “ten, nine, eight” people. And they know that. That’s probably why they know they can get away with it. They’re probably up there right now, scheming in their weird castle, just like, “Do you think we could spy on them using their very own cell phones?” And then another weird Nosferatu guy is like, “No, no. That’s a bridge too far.” “Even for us, that crosses a line.” Then they turn on the TV on New Years, and we’re like, “Three! Two!” They’re like, “We could do it and tell them we’re doing it, and they still won’t revolt.” [audience laughing] Speaking of which, listen to this. I wanna buy a dildo! Listen… I… shush. I wanna buy… shush. I wanna buy a dildo. I wanna buy a dildo. I have money… shush. I have money… shush. And I want to buy a 24-inch jelly… shush… sparkly dildo. I want to buy one. I have money, and I have cash. I want to buy a sparkly, 24… shush. Twenty-four-inch, butt-only jelly dildo. Listen, I want to buy a dildo. I want to buy one! I want to buy a dil… shush! I want to buy a dildo! [audience tittering] Enjoy those Instagram ads, everybody, enjoy them. [raucous laughter] [audience cheering] Yeah. [man] Yeah! For the next ten days, you’re gonna be scrolling, like, “Jesus Christ.” “Jelly, butt-only… I didn’t know they had that.” “I didn’t know they told you which orifice to cram it in, but there it is.” “I’ll get one. It’s technically Pete Holmes’ merch at this point.” [audience laughing] It’s ’cause our phones are listening. Some of you didn’t get it, and I can’t have that. That will not stand. I can’t have you go home tonight like, “How was the Pete show?” “Pretty good. Uh…” “One moment stood out as odd.” [audience laughing] It’s wonderful to be together again. I’m not taking this for granted, crammed together tight in a small room. It’s beautiful. You know something I’m never gonna stop doing that I picked up during the lockdown and I’ll never stop doing, no matter when COVID is a distant memory, I’m always gonna do this? I’m never gonna stop karate-kicking the crosswalk button. [audience laughing] It’s a good move. This was on the menu, why were we ever doing this? These are… We eat with these. That disgusting wet street metal? These are God’s forks. Why were we ever pushing… Why were we ever pushing God’s forks onto that wet nickel? It’s always got a sheen on it, ’cause you know ten minutes earlier, an unhoused person was rubbing his foreskin all over it. Just like, “I’m the mayor.” Just like gettin’ a… gettin’ a good coat. Gettin’ a good coat! This is beautiful. You’re making a great sound right now. You’re laughing. But you’re also a little confused. I like that. [audience laughing] And I agree with you. That’s a confusing joke. That joke needs to pick a lane. I’m sensitive enough to say “unhoused.” [audience laughing] But I’m still like, “You know they’re putting their dick on stuff, right?” Those precious outdoor angels. [laughing] I don’t know. [audience laughing] “Outdoor angels.” I didn’t care for that. I crossed my own line. You ever hear someone say something you didn’t like, and it was you? [audience laughing] I got soft during the lockdown. I knew I was in trouble. You ever take the top off a pint of ice cream and just throw the lid away? [audience laughing] Like a fresh pint. Just like, “This is a single',\n",
       "  '-use item.” [audience laughing] “I’m not gonna lie to myself tonight.” “There’s been an ice cream avalanche, and I’m not gonna stop until every cookie dough chunk comes home.” Sometimes I do that. I’ll fight through. There’s a third left and I don’t even want it, but I’m like, “It’s a rescue mission.” “Some of these guys got kids.” [audience laughing] I knew I was in trouble during the lockdown ’cause I went back to eating Cool Ranch Doritos. That’s the right response. It’s a perfect chip. I hadn’t had one since junior high, but the mad scientists at Frito-Lay fuckin’ cracked the Da Vinci Code right there. Only took ’em 100,000 ingredients. But I forgot, there’s a charge to it. You put a Cool Ranch on your tongue, it’s like licking a 9-volt battery. [audience laughing] And there’s so many chemicals in it, your brain is confused. It’s like, “Is this sex?” Like, it doesn’t know. I knew things were getting out of control ’cause I was alone on my couch eating a big bag of battery sex chips… [audience laughing] …and I burped, and when my mouth was open for the burp, I threw in more chips. [audience laughing] Just like a weird fat-guy multitask. Just like, “While we’re at it, let’s not let this opportunity pass us by.” Just shoveling more coal into the Titanic. I don’t own a scale. You want to know how I found out I was getting soft? I shot a video of my wife and daughter kicking a soccer ball at the park. I shot it on my phone. And when I played the video for a friend, we could… BS… We could both hear me breathing. [audience laughing] I wasn’t in the video. But I was like the soundtrack to the video, ’cause the camera was just a little too close to my face, so I’m like… [labored breathing] I’m like, “Where did I shoot this? Leering in the bushes?” They’re on level ground. How am I the only one going uphill in this footage? [labored breathing] There was an involuntary lip smack at one point. [smacking lips loudly] Just like… [smacks lips loudly] Like I’m in line at a buffet watching a guy in chefs’ whites carve roast beef for me. And I’m… [smacking lips loudly] [breathes heavily] Thicker. [smacks lips, breathes heavily] Thicker. We found one of my favorite spots in the routine. [smacks lips, breathes heavily] Thicker. I’d do it all night. If it would delight you, I’d keep doing it. [smacks lips, breathes heavily] Thicker. Nope! Nope! Nope, nope, nope! Shush! I want to buy a dildo! Shush. [audience laughing] Some of my friends got really jacked during the lockdown. My friend Kumail. You might know Kumail. [audience cheering] And honestly, he looks incredible. I’m proud of him. But I wouldn’t want that body. I couldn’t do it. But even if there was a lever I could push and just have it, I wouldn’t do it. First of all, I don’t want anyone looking at me and knowing what I’m up to all day. [audience laughing] You see someone that ripped, you’re like, “You going to the gym, Jim?” “Hey, Jim, you on your way to the gym?” “Whey protein, Jim? What is it, Jim?” Look at this mystery. [audience laughing] You don’t have shit. My body does not narc on my calendar. Do you understand? You’re like, “Something with pancakes?” You’re getting warm. Going to petting zoos and waving at the animals? Warmer, warmer. Honestly, given the choice between a soft body and a hard body, I’d choose soft every time. Soft! Are you fucking kidding me? Soft! [audience members whopping] It’s tru… Thank you. This show never works in LA. Everybody in LA wants to be a sports car. Fuck that. I wanna be a Winnebago with one flat tire. Do you understand? You ever hugged someone who’s jacked? I’ve hugged Kumail. There’s no healing. [audience laughing] There’s no catharsis. You let go, and you’re like, “Are you mad at me?” [audience laughing] Everybody wants to be a box spring. Fuck that. I wanna be a Tempur-Pedic mattress. Do you understand? You hugged me? Yeah. You hugged me? You’re welcome you hug me. There’s memory foam coating over every inch of my body. You hug me, there’s a sink and a sizzle. Do you understand? You think it’s a man, then you start moving in and you’re like, “Oh, it’s an experience.” [audience laughing] It’s like when you sit on a padded toilet seat but you didn’t know it was a padded toilet seat. It’s a surprise. And you’re like, “Oh, going down!” [hisses] That’s what it’s like. And you move into me, and you can weep in the safety and security of my boob shadow. And when I release you, both you and your trauma are set free like a flock of birds. That’s a fucking hug. [audience cheering and applauding] Yeah. That’s a hug. Everyone’s better for it. Look, obviously, all bodies are beautiful, but here’s my defense of soft. Nobody sticks up for soft. Here’s my defense. Hard looks good, but does it feel good? Fuck right. No! [audience laughing] If you’re gonna have sex with a jacked person, you’re in a hotel room and they drop their silken robe and you just see them naked with the lights on? Enjoy that. ‘Cause that’s as good as it gets. You can just be like, “Wow!” “The sight of effort and achievement.” [audience laughing] But then you flick the lights off, it’s perfect darkness, you just start feeling around for a body. You’re like, “Is that you or the desk? What did I feel?” “What am I grinding right now? Is this a banister?” “Am I fucking carved wood right now? Is this… Is this carved wood?” If I twist your head, does pepper come out of your feet? How far does this go? And I’m not alone, by the way. History is on my side. If you like soft, history is on your side too. Go to any museum. Who were they carving? Who were they painting? Thick, beautiful women. Women that were… Yeah. [women cheering] Women that would survive a pla',\n",
       "  'gue. Or childbirth, or a six-month boat voyage from England to New England. Do you think Keira Knightley would survive a six-month boat voyage from England to New England? She would die day two, and they’d use her bones for kindling. Do you understand? You need big women. Women that can live on crackers and hope for months. [audience laughing and cheering] “Rubenesque,” they call it. Go to the museum, they’re like, “This is Rubenesque women.” I don’t know why. I think it means they never turned down a Reuben. These women loved Reubens. [audience laughing] Women that would walk into Michelangelo’s studio and drop the velour curtain they’re wearing, and Michelangelo’d be like… [in Italian accent] “I need more marble.” [in normal voice] You know, like a big… [audience laughing] Ooh! Old Mikey’s got a big job ahead of him today! I was worried about that one. [audience laughing] But you guys stayed with it. I was worried that you guys might be a little too sweet for that. I know you have all types here, but in the Midwest, people generally are a little bit sweeter. Than LA, at least. That’s for sure. I’ll tell you my favorite Minnesota story. It’s not a Minneapolis story. It’s a Minnesota story. I was driving through the state… This put me in a good mood for about six months. I pulled off the highway, I went to a supermarket, I got a coconut water. I opened it in the store. I’ve never done cocaine, but I will drink a drink before I’ve paid for it. [audience laughing] This is the irreverent, bad-boy humor you signed up for tonight. You hear that safety seal break, you’re like, “Ooh, it’s a rush.” You know what I mean? Then you walk around drinking it, proud. Can’t hide it. You have to be like a sheriff, like, “Yeah, just checking it out.” Walk around… like you work there. Like, “Hey, Kyle? Can we get more Sun Chips on seven?” You know, like that. And I walked around so long I finished the coconut water. I drank the whole one. One of those cardboard bottles. This is what put me in a good mood. I got up to the register, there’s this Midwest beauty queen, she was in her fifties or sixties, I put down the bottle, I said, “Hi. I’d like to buy this coconut water, but I finished it.” This is what put me in a good mood for six months. She went… “You devil.” [audience laughing] That’s all it takes. Joy is so easy. A Midwestern woman called me the devil! For hydrating on my own timetable. I think about this woman every day. She lives rent-free in my heart. My feet didn’t touch the ground. Calling me the devil! Also, that’s not devil shit. The devil, excuse me? The… Are you hear… The devil? The devil does fucked-up shit. You ever read the Bible? You ever read the OT? I’m sorry, what do you call it? The Old Testament? You ever crack the prequel? Bored in church, waiting for the service to start, flipping around Leviticus, just like, “Jesus Chr… Well…” “Not yet.” And then just put it back. [audience laughing] Some of you call it “the OT.” I feel like… I feel like you’re my people. Usually people are like, “What?” And you guys were like, “Yes, the first testament.” [audience laughing] “They’re both old, Peter. The first testament.” I was raised religious. It’s not… It’s not just my face and overall demeanor. I’m not gonna shit on it. It actually taught me a lot of good things. It made me very polite. I was very polite about sex. Like when I lost my virginity, I didn’t just ask my first wife for her consent, I actually asked her dad. Not… not literally. But, you know, I was a virgin, she was a virgin, and I asked him if I could marry her, so, you know… Subtitles on. [audience laughing] What are you really saying? Weird question from a guy you barely know who’s sometimes in your home. Just like, “Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?” [audience laughing] [breathing heavily] “Pardon me, Papa?” [audience laughing] [continues breathing heavily] “I have a rather urgent, rather pressing issue to raise with you today.” “Would you mind…” [continues breathing heavily] “May I…” “May I plow your baby?” [audience laughing] [heavy breathing intensifies] Sliding him the wedding invite, like, “This is the night it’s gonna happen.” ‘Would you save that date for me?” [breathing heavily] “Would you walk her to me?” [audience laughing] “Would you lead her, like you would lead a good, good pony?” I’ll be standing at the altar, horny as a 22-year-old virgin, just like, “Ten! Nine!” [audience cheering and applauding] He gets her to me, I’m like, “I’ll take it from here.” [growls loudly] The first time I got married, our honeymoon suite was above the dance floor. That’s a bit much. Telling him that, like, “You’ll be near, sir.” Think about that. We went right upstairs. Of course. Are you kidding? Waited my whole life to have sex. We went right upstairs. So the dad was 30 feet below us, like… [singing silly song] I feel you backing away. [continues singing] Thirty feet above him, I was like, “Oh, this is what all the buzz was about!” Thirty feet below us, he’s like… [singing] “I paid for this.” [audience laughing] See? Sweeter. You should hear that joke in New York. They’re like, “Yeah, fuck dads!” You guys are like, “I don’t know.” “I don’t know if this is respectful to our elders.” You sweetie-patities. I love you. Never change. If you’re offended by that joke, I completely agree. [audience laughing] Isn’t that refreshing? It is an offensive joke. I think it’s so funny when comedians get accused of being offensive, they’re always like, “What?! Get real.” I offend myself every day. And so do you, if you watch your thoughts. You ever come home from a party, drop your keys on the counter just like, “Ha! I am not for everyone.” You know what I mean?',\n",
       "  ' Just… [audience laughing] It’s nothing new. It’s been offensive the whole time. I try to be good. I don’t do a lot of drugs. I’m the kind of guy that can’t tell when other people were on drugs. Anyone else like that? [audience] Yeah. Right? I leave a party, I’m like, “Who was that sweaty, confident man?” [audience laughing] “He had an idea for several exciting new businesses.” Try to be good. I call home once a week. I FaceTime my mom’s forehead every Sunday. [laughing] Last time we FaceTimed, my mom saw how long my hair is getting, and this is a quote, she went, “Petey, sweetie, you look like Johnny Damon from that movie Good Luck Hunting.” [audience laughing] That’s a lot of mistakes to cram into one sentence… from a woman living in Boston. [audience laughing] I didn’t know what to say. I went, “How do you like them bananas?” And I just moved on. I do call my mom every Sunday. Except this week, she called me on a Monday, which was a nightmare. We had just spoken on Sunday. Anyone else have a parent in their eighties you call on a designated day, then they break the routine? Isn’t that terrifying? I was at work, I saw the phone lighting up, it said “Mom,” I immediately go to worst-case. I’m like, “Who fell? Who died?” “Or worse, she just wants to chat.” Like… [audience laughing] But I didn’t answer. And I called her back while she was leaving me a voicemail. Now, my mom is a very with-it lady. She just gets a little confused by technology, like we all do. So I have the funniest voicemail in the world ’cause she was leaving me a voicemail, and I called her on the other line, and she thought the call waiting beeps were the voicemail greeting beeps… If I see you after the show, I’ll play it. It’s the best message. She’s like, “Hello, Petey, sweetie, it’s your mother.” “I’m calling today because I…” [audience laughing] “Hello, Petey, sweetie, it’s your mother.” “I’m calling you this afternoon because I…” [audience laughing] [in worried voice] “Hello, Petey, sweetie…” The third one, she was a little scared. Each message was a little bit different. That’s what made it amazing. It’s like when someone you work with sends you the same email twice by accident, but you can tell they wrote it up fresh both times, and you scour it for differences. You’re like, “‘Sincerely?’ What happened to ‘Best Wishes, ‘ Ted?” It was like that. I get confused by technology too. You know what scares the hell out of me? You know when you go to a website and it’s like, “Wait.” “Before you come in, prove you’re not a robot.” Then there’s a grid, and it’s like, “Find all the frames that have crosswalks in it.” I freeze up. Those scare the hell out of me. I overthink it. I do the easy ones real fast, but then I’m like, “There is a smidge of white in the lower left that could be a crosswalk.” ‘Cause you don’t wanna get it wrong. What happens if you get it wrong, an alarm goes off, it’s like, “Beep-boop, you’re a robot”? [audience laughing] They come and take you away? Is this how we found Alexa? Is this how we got Alexa? She was just a sweet old woman who tested bad? Now she’s cursed to be a hockey puck on our mantels that we bark orders at, just ’cause she was a sweet old woman who couldn’t find all the bicycles? Okay, forget it. [audience laughing] Sweet old woman who couldn’t find the bicycles? If I was in the crowd, I’d be like, “Yeah!” I’d be losing it. You guys are doing great, but that is right up my alley. I’d be like, “Finally!” “The mystery of Alexa has been solved!” [audience laughing] I probably shouldn’t make fun of my mom. I’m getting older. I turn 44 this year. I’ll tell ya. Anybody in their twenties worried about getting older? It’s not that bad. I’ll tell ya. The… Right? Not that bad. [applause] The main difference being 24 and 44? So when I was 24, I would pee, and, you know, shake it. Having a penis is so humiliating. Like, none of us are talking about it, but every guy… I shouldn’t be telling you this. Every guy in the room, we pee, and we go… [gibbering] There’s no… there’s no technology that can save us from… [gibbering] That’s the best strategy we have. Throughout human history. Abraham Lincoln was like, “I’ll address you in a moment, Gettysburg.” [gibbering] It’s humiliating. It’s a wonder any of you listen to us. But the main difference when I was 24, I would pee, I would shake it, zip it up, and walk away. Now that I’m 44, I would pee, shake it, zip it up, walk away, and then like 30 seconds later, just more pee comes out. [audience laughing] Not a lot, but, you know, enough to halt a conversation. [raucous laughter] It merits a pause. You’re like, “Have I seen the new Avatar?” [moans uncomfortably] That’s “the way of water” right there. That’s what that is. It’s not a lot. It’s like one penis-length. [audience laughing] It’s not a lot. It’s like an air lock, like an air lock on a spaceship, of pee. And it’s… So, for me, quite a bit. Okay, that’s… that’s ridiculous. [audience laughing] You know, enough to put out a campfire. It’s like, remember in the ’90s, you’d listen to a Dave Matthews CD, and at the end of the CD, you’d think it was over, but there’d be, like, three minutes of silence and then they’d come out and be like, “Just kidding,” and they’d play, like, a hidden song? It’s like that… [audience laughing] …but for pee-pee. And if you get that reference, it’s definitely happening to you. [raucous laughter] That’s not entirely true. There are other differences getting older. I hurt myself a lot more easily. I was laid out for two days. I’ll tell you what happened. I was in the shower. It was a cold shower ’cause I’m in my forties and I just want to feel… something. [audience laughing] And I g',\n",
       "  'ot the novel idea, like an Irish Spring soap commercial from the ’80s, I was like, “I’m gonna crouch down, put my face in the jet spray, and just go… [gibbering]” And that’s what I did. I went… [gibbering] …and went… [yells] And I was laid out for… I’m not leaving anything out. That’s the story. I crouched… Everybody in their forties is like, “It’s the crouch. The crouch is probably…” “You can go like this, or you can go like this, but you can’t do both.” “You should know that. You… you should know that.” “That one’s on you.” It’s true. I’m afraid to do it right now. Like, it could happen again. Do you realize what this means? I can’t go like this… [gibbering] Which… I can’t… I can’t motorboat my wife’s boobs. Do you understand? [audience laughing] Do you know what motorboating is? Then where’s the laugh? I can’t motorboat my wife’s boobs. If I want to motorboat my wife’s boobs, I have to sit on the edge of the bed. [audience laughing] I have to sit on the edge of the bed like a good little boy. Or like Anna Nicole Smith’s melting husband. I can just sit there, still, and then she can come in and move her boobs while I sit still. Like a car wash. Like… [gibbering] Or it’s like a play where there’s a fake car in the middle of the stage, and everything else moves, but you stay still. It’s like that. A boy goes by with a crescent moon on a fishing line. I’ve never done this this long. [audience laughing] That’s how I motorboat my wife now. [man whoops] Going to the doc… [laughs] I hear you. I hear you. I see you. You’re valuable. [audience laughing] You matter. You’re beautiful. Going to the doctor is, uh, different when you’re in your forties. I had to get my prostate checked. Every comedian gets his prostate exam joke. This is mine. Here’s my hot take. Wasn’t that bad. Yeah. What’s the big deal? It was gentle. It was like a hummingbird pollinating a giant… Like a… Like a gaping yellow flower, just… [buzzing] It was fine. I was like, “That was it? Do it again. That was fine. No big deal.” And now I’m fresh for another season. That’s exciting. But the best part was my doctor completely underestimated how tall I am. I’m 6’6″. And I’m standing by the table. The table was about this tall. She was off in the corner putting on a glove and lubing it up, like an assassin putting a silencer on a pistol, just like… “I’ll be with you in a moment.” And so she’s over there, and she goes, “Put your chest on the table.” She’s an authority figure, and she told me to do it. I was like, “That’s a little guy order. Little guy.” Little guy’s like, “Aye-aye, madam,” and he just goes down. “Slide right in there like an open parking spot. It’s okay.” But I’m 6’6″. I’m a giraffe. This woman’s about to become a zoologist. But she’s an authority figure, so I’m, like, in a backless, gaping robe, I’m just like, “Okay,” and I go down like one of those plastic drinking waterbirds. I can feel the breeze twixt… twixt my cheeks. Just waiting, and I go, this is literally what I said, I go, “This feels low.” [audience laughing] And then I… I went up to my elbows. Thankfully, she did not. Okay. [laughing] [audience laughing] That was ridiculous. This is true. After she did it, I gave her a hug. [audience laughing] Why can’t you hug your doctor? I don’t know, she was all up in me. You do something that intimate, you’re gonna get squeezed. Just like… Just like… [kisses] A little… [audience laughing] [kisses] Just on the top of the head. [smooching] I pay my premiums. [kisses] She leans up for it. [kissing] [audience laughing] I have a four-and-a-half-year-old now. Yeah. It’s great. [audience cheering] She’s growing up so fast. She vapes now. She vapes. She… [laughs] Crème brûlée, that’s her flavor. When we smell it, that’s how we know she’s home. I loved having a baby during the lockdown because I got to be there for all the big moments. I was there for her first steps. I was there for her first word. This is true, it was “cracker.” Which I found racially insensitive. [audience laughing] Remember it like it was yesterday. I’m on the couch, she’s in a diaper next to me, she goes, “Cracker!” [audience laughing] Cinched up my robe. I’m like… I prefer “honky,” but okay. [audience laughing] Alexa, turn off the Matchbox Twenty. [audience laughing] Getting called racial slurs out here. I love being a dad. My daughter has a lot of the same toys we had when we were growing up. She just has better versions of the same toy. Like, I had a See ‘n Say growing up. Remember the See ‘n Say? Remember it spins, points at an animal, makes a sound of the animal? We had that in the ’80s. It just sounded like shit. Pull the string, it would land on the cow, it would be like… [makes static noise] [muffled vocalizations, then more static noise] [muffled moaning] I’m three years old, sitting on my play mat, like, “Is that the sound of a cow?” [audience laughing] “I’m new here. I’m taking this from you.” My daughter has the same toy, it’s just crystal-clear, digital surround-sound… There’s an announcer. It sounds fantastic. He goes, like… [in announcer voice] “This is the sound of a horse.” [in normal voice] Then it’s like… [neighs realistically] It’s a real horse! You can tell someone went in a barn with a horse and was like, “Action,” and they got it. Which is even more impressive ’cause they got dangerous animals. They got a coyote. I didn’t even know what a coyote sounded like up close, but it’s like… [in announcer voice] “This is the sound of a coyote.” [mimics complex calls and howling of a coyote] [in normal voice] Sitting with my daughter like, “That’s so specific.” [audience laughing] “It’s gotta be real.” “We’re both learning.” [audience laughing] ',\n",
       "  'When it lands on the dog, the sound quality is so good, when the toy barks, my dog barks. But this is what makes it a joke. [audience laughing] I don’t just describe the toy. Hundred percent real. I would never lie in the set-up of a joke. You pull the string, it lands on the cat, 100% real, it goes… [in announcer voice] “This is the sound of a cat.” “Meow.” [audience laughing] [in normal voice] Minnesota, it’s just the guy. [audience laughing] It’s, like, clearly just the guy. It’s the guy barely trying to sound like it’s not just the guy. Do you realize what this means? They couldn’t get a cat. [audience laughing] They couldn’t get a cat to play ball. They got a coyote. They got a coyote to cooperate. That is how much of an asshole every American house cat is. It’s like, “No!” [audience laughing] That is a story. That is a man in a room filled with scratching posts with a boom mic and dozens of cats, just like, “Come on!” [audience laughing] “For fuck’s sake!” “Get off of me!” The dog’s in the corner like, “I’ll happily bark again if it would move things along.” “I’m just happy to be a part of this team.” [audience laughing] “I’m a good boy.” I wanna be a good dad. I feel like dads can go either way. [scattered laughter] Thank you to the 22 people that laughed at that. They’re my instant favorites. Moms can go either way too, obviously, but the mom and the baby, they have a head start with each other ’cause the baby lives inside the mom for nine months. So the baby’s sort of pre-programmed to love the mom. Like an iPhone. Baby comes out, mom looks at the baby, baby unlocks. [audience laughing] Dad’s just the weird, hairy helper in the shadows. [groans creepily] “What’s the passcode?” “Don’t run from me.” “I have nipples too.” [audience laughing] So many dads are like the part of the space shuttle that falls off after mom and baby reach orbit. Just like, “Let me know if you need me to lift anything heavy.” I didn’t want to do that. I wanted to be involved. So even when Val, my wife, was pregnant, I was trying to think of ways to protect the baby. I was like, that’s a good thing dads can do. I’ll protect the baby. And I had no idea… I freaked out ’cause I had no idea what to do if a baby is choking. You can’t give a baby the Heimlich maneuver. That’s grown-ass person shit. Can’t be at a diner like, “Oh, is your baby choking?” [bang] [audience laughing] You’ll break the baby. So I wanted to look it up, so I YouTubed it. I YouTubed “babies choking.” Yeah. So I’m on a list. I’m on a list! [audience laughing] Just feels good to be included on a list. And I can feel some of you beautiful Minnesotans backing away. [audience laughing] And that’s beautiful. Do not change. That means you’re not a sociopath. It is a dark subject, but here’s what makes it a joke. Even though it’s a dark subject, these YouTube videos are just like any other YouTube video. It’s like a 22-year-old kid being like, “What’s up, Safe Squad?” [audience laughing] “My name is Tyler.” “I’m here to show you what to do if a baby is choking.” [audience laughing] “But before I do, guys, mash that Subscribe button, and make sure notifications are turned on.” I counted. There was a seven-minute intro before he got into it. Seven minutes! I’m sitting at home, like, “Pick up the pace, Tyler.” “Some families are watching this in a pickle, okay?” [audience laughing] We don’t need to hear about your merch, pal. Time is of the essence. Ticktock, ticktock. You wanna know what it is? If the baby’s facing you, you turn it around, back towards you, and you hit it. That’s it. Medical science. Men and women in lab coats went in, and all you do is flip it and hit it. Which means every drunk dad in the ’70s was right just guessing. [audience laughing] They’re like, “Yep, that’s what the data shows.” “Having a lit cigarette dangling from your lip does help for some reason. We don’t know why.” “In a related study, the best cure for the hiccups is being called a pussy.” “We have the numbers.” [audience laughing] I loved having a baby during the lockdown. Gave me something to do. Gave me purpose. Gave me fun things to do too. I remember one afternoon, my wife was pulling into the driveway with groceries that we were gonna put on the porch and spray down… [audience laughing] Remember that? Even at the height of it, when I was doing that, I was like, “This is bullshit, right?” [audience laughing] It’s not on Wheat Thins. And if it is, maybe we should just say good night with some dignity. [all laughing] But I’m like you guys. I wanna live my life. I wanna get silly. I wanna laugh. I wanna meet my own joy quota. So I’m not just gonna go out and say “hello” to my wife. I’m holding the baby, she’s like eight, nine weeks old, wearing a diaper, I decide a funny way to say hello would be to go out to the driveway, pull my daughter’s diaper down, and mash her baby buns on the driver’s-side window. I thought this was a novel and fun way to say “Ahoy.” [audience laughing] Some of you are backing away. It’s not gross. It’s a baby butt. It’s not like my… My butt would be gross. It’s a baby butt. Like two little silver dollar pancakes. [audience laughing] Like two Chinese steamed dumplings, and you just kind of move them around. And that’s what I did. I heard my wife park, I mashed the baby’s butt, I pulled her diaper down, I mashed the baby butt, and I started moving it around. I’m laughing. The baby’s laughing. We look in the car. Val is horrified. I look again… [laughs] …the baby was shitting. The baby was shit… [raucous laughter] Like, that’s why they need the diaper. As soon as I put the buns on the glass, it was like, “This gives me an idea.” [gibbering] And I’m',\n",
       "  ' just smearing fresh, so fresh, farm-to-table, biodynamic, organic, vegan baby shit, and I’m smearing it around like a red-light hobo in reverse. Those precious outdoor angels. I’m smearing it around. There’s like a brown hourglass shape where the buns were. And when I was hosing off the window, I was like, “You know what? I don’t care if I die. Daddy needs to go for a walk.” [laughing] “Daddy’s… Daddy needs some fresh air.” You guys are on the fence on that one. I like that. It’s good to know what’s Minnesota-edgy. [audience laughing] It’s what we should call the special. “Minnesota-Edgy: The Bad Boy’s Back.” “Have you noticed Capri Suns are difficult as fuck to open?” “Dude, not safe for TV!” [raucous laughter] Kids are real, and they’re right about everything. [audience members whooping] It’s true. Sometimes I catch myself going, “Don’t splash in the tub,” and I’m like, “What… What? Yeah, it’s tile. Splash it up.” “Live your life. I want you to be joyful.” My daughter’s right about everything too. She calls chopsticks “chompsticks.” That was right there. That’s correct. You don’t chop with them, you chomp with them. She calls porcupines “poke-u-pines.” That’s two for two, baby girl. [audience laughing] They poke ya. They don’t pork ya. [audience laughing] Be funner if Seinfeld… [mimicking Seinfeld] They don’t pork ya! [audience laughing] They poke you! And you chomp. You don’t chop. [in normal voice] Kids also know what’s going on. They know. They think about stuff and understand stuff you wouldn’t believe. I’ll give you an example. I was dropping Lila off at school. We were quite late ’cause it was a daddy drop-off. [audience laughing] And her little preschool had already circled up on the carpet, and Lila was feeling shy, so she didn’t want to go in without me, so I carried her in. And we walked into the circle, and I sat down, with her on my lap. And we sat right across from her friend Dean. Now, I’d misjudged Dean. I thought Dean was very normcore. He’s a little boy. But I thought he was norm… Yeah. [laughing] [audience laughing] He’s like four years old. I was like, “This guy’s normcore.” I’m out here judging. I’m out here judging. You don’t get a pass just ’cause you’re a toddler. I’m judging everything. I even called him “Dean the Saltine” right to his face. I’d be like, “Hey, Dean the Saltine.” He doesn’t get it. Relax. Sometimes I call him “Dean the Jellybean” if he was wearing something colorful. [audience laughing] So we sit right across from Dean, and the kids are singing this song they clearly knew very well. I had never heard it before. But it was like… ♪ Ten little monkeys up in the tree ♪ ♪ Saying, “Hey, alligator You can’t catch me” ♪ Then one of the monkeys falls, and they make that rhyme somehow. [audience laughing] And then all the kids together went, “And snap!” ♪ Nine little monkeys up in the tree ♪ I’m sitting here like, this is a dark song. I look at the teacher like, “Is this what you do all day?” But the kids loved it. They went, “Nine, eight monkeys, seven monkeys…” ♪ “No more monkeys up in the tree” ♪ And there was a moment of silence, which was warranted. [audience laughing] And in the silence, one of the cute little girls, Maeve, she just goes, “What happened to the monkeys?” Yeah. The teacher’s like… [stammering nervously] [audience laughing] One of the kids goes, “They ran away.” An optimist. [audience laughing] Another kid goes, “They swam away.” An optimist that remembers we’re by a river. [audience laughing] Then fuckin’ Dean. [audience laughing] Dean’s quiet. He’s leaning, as if on a Jukebox. [audience laughing] He’s lounging, like a sultan. His eyes go black, and into the silence, he projects, “They died!” [audience laughing] The teacher’s like, “No, no, no, no.” Dean goes… [in toddler voice] “Yeah, blood in the water!” [audience laughing] [in normal voice] How fuckin’ metal is Dean? He didn’t just understand it, he was picturing the pigmentation in the water. “Blood in the water!” That’s the most metal thing I’ve ever seen. Should’ve been like, “Blood in the water!” [mimicking monkey vocalization] Like, that was incredible! I completely misjudged him. I’m sorry, Dean. I don’t call him “Dean the Saltine” anymore. That’s for damn sure. I call him “Dean the Machine.” Or “Dean the Jellybean” if he’s wearing something colorful. [all laughing] Music is powerful, man. You know what always makes me… makes my heart warm? You know what always makes my heart warm? You know what always makes my heart “worm…” Like, “worm”? You know what makes my heart warm? Hey, do you know what ma… [laughing] [audience laughing] We promise to enjoy whatever happens. Okay. [laughing] [audience cheering and applauding] You know what makes my heart warm is those stories of nursing homes where there’s like a woman in her nineties who hasn’t moved in, like, two years, and they roll her into a room with a phonograph, and they put on a record, and it’s like… [mimicking phonograph playing record] And all of a sudden, she’s like… [mimicking old woman humming song] A Haitian nurse walking by is just weeping. Just like… He just happens to be Haitian. It’s just a detail. Fuckin’ relax. [audience laughing] Just crying. A beautiful Haitian nurse. That always warms my heart, but it got me thinking. What are they gonna do with me? God willing I live long enough to be in a nursing home, what are they gonna do if I stop moving? Roll me into a room with a first-gen iPod? [audience laughing] They hit play, it’s like… ♪ Somebody… ♪ [humming indistinctly] A Haitian nurse starts crying. [audience laughing] But this time, he sparks and smokes ’cause it’s a robot, okay? [all laughing] In the room next to ',\n",
       "  'him, there’s a guy in a bathrobe and slippers dancing with no one. Like… ♪ “Cut my life into pieces” ♪ [all laughing] All the nurses are crying, like, “They’re back! They’re back!” Music is powerful. I was so desperate to hang out in a group after the lockdown, I went to a basketball game. It was fun. I’m not a sport… I’m not like a… I’m not a sport. [audience laughing] But it was fun. It was a good game. The characters… [laughing] “The characters.” [audience laughing] They were off-book. Uh, they knew all their blocking perfectly. But it was fun, and it was a very intense game. I was thinking about it afterwards. I was like, “Of course it was.” For, like, 45 minutes before the game started, they were warming up and blasting jock jams. It was like DMX. Like… [mimicking DMX] ♪ Y’all gonna make me lose my mind ♪ And like… [yells] [in normal voice] Of course it was intense. They’re all in the paint throwing bowls. I know the lingo. [audience laughing] But again, I was like, basketball is a really, really old game. How did they get the players psyched in the ’30s? Just a coach in khaki shorts with white socks up to his knees on the sidelines next to a record player, like… [mimicking John Mulaney] “Let’s get aggressive, boys!” [audience laughing] [in normal voice] Don’t know why it’s Mulaney, but it’s Mulaney. [mimicking John Mulaney] Let’s… Let’s get aggressive, boys! [in normal voice] Puts the needle down, like… [swooshing air] [mimicking John Mulaney] ♪ My girl’s name is Shirley ♪ [all laughing] ♪ I get her home real early ♪ ♪ I’ll take the one brown dog With the two green eyes ♪ [audience laughing, applauding] ♪ My girls smells like kidney beans ♪ [laughs] [in normal voice] You guys got the set-up. You can make your own up. [audience laughing] On the ride home, delight each other. I believe in God. Relax. [audience laughing] I believe in God, but I hate when other people believe in God. [audience laughing and cheering] Can you relate to that? I love my God, but sometimes people know I’m a spiritual person, they’ll come out of the shadows after the show, like, “I believe in God.” I’m like, “What? Get the fuck…” What is this, a murder-suicide? Get back in your Lyft. I don’t wanna talk. But every comedian is an atheist. Almost every single comedian I know is an atheist. And I gotta tell you, from where I’m standing, it looks so fucking cool. Atheism, the cigarette of beliefs. [audience laughing] Just leaning on your motorcycle, like, “You think there’s something going on here? Get real!” [audience laughing] It is the motorcycle of philosophies. Just like, “Born alone, die alone, ride alone.” It’s like that. [audience laughing] And religion is like the station wagon I got from my mom. Like… [honking] “Honk if you love Jesus.” It’s just not as cool. But I, personally, I’m so tired of comedians burning down a straw man, making fun of people who believe in God, being like… [in British accent] “Do you really think a talking snake gave a naked lady an apple?” [in normal voice] I’m like, “Come on. It’s a metaphor, Ricky.” [audience laughing] Always true, sometimes really happened. Do you understand? Like, my God is not an old man in the sky. It’s a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all categories of human thought, including being a non-being, but that’s too many words for the back of a quarter. [audience laughing] That’s Joseph Campbell. I got all the best teachers later in life. Like Barry Taylor, the road manager for AC/DC, said, “‘God’ is the name of the blanket we put over the mystery to give it a shape.” Shouldn’t I have learned that in church? [audience laughing] Why am I learning this from Barry Taylor… the road manager for AC/DC? [audience laughing] But it doesn’t matter if you’re an atheist, you’re a theist, I actually think we’re all kinda in the same boat. Really, I do. Some people think God created the universe. Some people think nothing created the universe. Which is the funniest guess? [audience laughing] The “nothing” people make fun of the “God” people. They say, “God doesn’t exist.” I’m like, “Okay, maybe.” But you know what definitely doesn’t exist? Nothing. [audience laughing] That’s the defining characteristic of nothing, is that it doesn’t exist. So what are we talking about? Either you think it’s God, something you can’t see, touch, taste, photograph, and science can’t prove, or you think it’s nothing, something you can’t see, touch, taste, photograph, and science can’t prove. But I think we can all agree if nothing, if your nothing, sometimes spontaneously erupts into everything, that’s a pretty goddamn magical fucking nothing, you guys. [audience laughing] And ask… ask the “nothing” people, “What happens when you die?” They’ll tell you, “Nothing. You go into nothing.” I’m like, “You mean you merge back with your creator?” [audience laughing] “That’s heaven, bitch.” [all laughing] So no one, no matter what you believe, you shouldn’t be afraid to die. ‘Cause if you go into nothing, and one of the things nothing does is explode into everything, nothing isn’t the end, it’s just a pit stop on the way to a new beginning. Let’s pray. Heavenly Father, you are, in fact, no thing. [audience laughing and applauding] You ever have to poop so bad you pee second? [audience laughing] Look at this. Look at this. This… This is why live comedy matters. I’ve told that joke on Zoom. It’s okay. [audience laughing] But here, you laugh, and you look around, and you see you’re not alone. It’s everyone. Sometimes you sit on the toilet, and you’re just like, “Oh God, that was urgent,” Like, it happens. The old two-one punch, we call it. Sometimes the appetizer arrives at the table after th',\n",
       "  \"e entrée. It’s a mix-up. It’s a mix-up in the kitchen. I have told that joke before. I don’t want you to feel bad. I am… seeing other audiences. [audience laughing] One time I said, “You ever have to poop so bad you pee second?” And right where you guys are… Are you a couple? Right where this cute couple is, I go, “You ever have to poop so bad you pee second?” And the husband starts pointing at the wife, going, “Her!” [audience laughing] “Her!” Trying to embarrass her. “Her!” It’s like, “How do you know that?” [audience laughing] “You’re the weird one now.” [audience laughing] What, are you spending your day ducked behind the shower curtain, just hiding out in the bathtub with an ear out? Just like… “Huh… Bam, tinkle, tinkle.” [audience laughing] “Somebody hit shuffle.” Okay. [audience laughing] My wife wrote that joke. Um… She also wrote this one. That’s a poop joke, this is a smarter joke. It’ll balance it out. We were standing on the beach, not to brag… [audience laughing] …and we were looking up at the stars, and my wife’s name is Valerie, she leaned over to me, she goes, “Stars are like hipsters.” [audience member laughs] I also laughed. [audience laughing] I laughed at that moment because we could die at any moment. [audience laughing] You should know that about me. I don’t wait for punchlines ’cause this could end. She goes, “Stars are like hipsters.” I’m like, “Whaddya mean?” She goes, “They’re up there twinkling like, ‘You’re just seeing this now?'” [audience laughing] “‘I did that like a billion years ago.'” It’s a light speed joke. It’s not for everybody. I love being married. You’re not gonna hear that a lot at comedy shows. But I do. She’s my best friend. I love sharing my life with somebody. It’s wonderful. I think being single is overrated. In movies, and TV especially, it’s all just doing shots and having sex. It’s not what I remember. [audience laughing] I remember awkward two-hour dinners with good posture, just being like, “What’s your favorite Harry Potter?” Or just like… [audience laughing] Put a gun on the table. “Or we could just end it.” [laughing] Just like… [audience laughing] “Should we call it a night?” You are sweetie-patities. And the best-case scenario is if you get that stranger to go home with you, or you go home with them, what’s the best-case scenario? You can kneel on a stranger’s bed, rolling on a condom, looking around, being like, “Why does she have an iguana?” Like, that’s the best. That’s the best-case. I love being married because you can show someone your real orgasm sound. [audience laughing] Thank you for not leaving me alone in a moment of artistic vulnerability. One woman was like, “Yeah!” Everyone else was like, “Proceed.” When you’re married, you can show someone your real orgasm sound. You can’t do that when you’re dating. When you’re dating, you can’t come real. You have to come cool. You want to come cool ’cause you want them to think you’re a neat-o guy. So you’re having sex, and you feel the orgasm creeping up, from the knee. I’ve had sex before. Every guy knows it creeps up from the knee, gingerly, like a daddy long-legs. And like, “Hoo boy, the finale is afoot.” [all laughing] And you have to make a choice. You’re like… [groans] Scrambling, like, “Quick! How would Indiana Jones come?” [audience laughing] And that’s what you do. You go, “Oh, this belongs in a museum!” You know, like that. [audience laughing] That’s what I did when I was dating Val. I’d be like, “The dog’s name was Indiana!” You know, cool… cool shit. But that’s not trust. That’s not intimacy. That’s not baring your soul. Val gets the real real. I’m gonna try to do it for you now. [audience laughing] Don’t back away. [audience laughing] Something real is happening that’s not on our phones. [laughing] [audience laughing] It’s like this… [grunting awkwardly] She’s right there. I can see her. [audience cheering] [grunts awkwardly] She’ll… She’ll tell me if I get this right. [grunting awkwardly, in strained voice] I trust you! [in normal voice] It’s like that. [audience laughing] That’s the sound of love. That’s the sound of intimacy. If you introduce your parents to… [grunts awkwardly] …that’s the sound. Put a ring on… [grunts awkwardly] In fact, if you’ve been dating a guy for over a year, and you haven’t heard… [grunting awkwardly] …fucking cut and run. That’s a Dirty John long con. That’s a sociopath. Get out of that situation. Guys, not every moment of your day has to be an expression of masculinity. Doesn’t have to be like, “Oh! I’m havin’ a Joe Rogan experience!” You need to… [audience laughing] …put your broadsword down and let someone love you tenderly. [audience laughing] I am straight. [audience laughing] The guy that just offers that out of nowhere. You’re on a road trip with one of your friends, he’s just staring out the window for 45 minutes, like, “You guys know I’m straight, right?” [audience laughing] How much are you thinking about dudes? Is it all the live-long day? But I’m straight. The reason I mention it is actually for a very positive reason, ’cause I feel like I was raised as a straight man to think that vaginas are great and dicks are icky-sticky-nicky. [audience laughing] And it’s not true. I don’t… I don’t think dicks are gross. I just think we’re all making the best of a bad situation. You know what I mean? [all laughing] They’re all gross, they’re all not gross. Both kinds. Both kinds are gross and not gross. They’re just… It’s the same shit. It’s the same ingredients. Just shuffled differently. One’s a jambalaya, one’s a paella, you know what I mean? [audience laughing] They’re both just… [laughing] They’re both just genitals. The perfect word for\",\n",
       "  ' what they are. Genitals. Just outside insides. Stuff that should have the decency to be up here but it’s like, “What if I came to the party?” And it’s like, “No!” Bat it back up with a broom. You just have to choose your nightmare. Choose! Which one do you want? You want one that’s like, “Blah!” Or one that’s like, “Heehaw!” [audience laughing] Choose your nightmare, commit, and act like you liked it the whole time. And no, you did not. I don’t care how “straight” you are as a woman. No woman saw a dick… Excuse me, a dick? And was like, “Yeah, babe!” “Get that in me!” [audience laughing] No. Someone had to walk you through that gently, like a PowerPoint presentation. They were like, “This is it in its resting phase, Jesus Christ.” [audience laughing] “Next slide, please.” “Jesus fucking Christ!” [audience laughing] “That’s halfway?” “That’s halfway!” [audience laughing] And I don’t care how “straight” you are as a guy, the first time we all saw a vagina, we were like, “Ha! Maybe some more Super Nintendo first. That is…” [audience laughing] “That is an acquired taste.” I’ve never seen a vagina that looked like it was expecting company. Always looked like the vagina was in the shower when you rang the doorbell, like, “I’ll be right out!” Women, don’t feel teased. Feel seen. [audience laughing] But nobody will admit this. No straight guy will admit this, that dicks aren’t grosser. It’s not gross. I’m always trying. Like one Thanksgiving… This is true. [audience laughing] One Thanksgiving, I was sitting next to my brother. He’s a straight guy. I was tired of listening to my father chew. [audience laughing] So I leaned over, I go, “Hey, dude.” I call him “dude.” I go, “Dude… you suck a dick for a million dollars?” Like a lot of the guys in the room, he didn’t think about it. He said, “Ugh, no! Ugh, no! Ugh!” Like, how about a little conversation? How about a little back-and-forth? We’re not going anywhere. How about a follow-up question? How about, “Do I know the guy?” That’s a good one. [audience laughing] Don’t wanna fire off a quick “yes” and be like, “It’s Dad.” “Fuck you. That’s a trap.” [audience laughing] But he said “no,” so I upped it. I wanted to see where the line was. I said, “Fifty mil? You suck a dick for 50 mil?” I can see some of the guys’ faces tightening up. The girls are like, “Dude, I’ve done it for two drinks at a TGI Fridays.” “You wouldn’t do it to never work again, you stupid fucks?” Like, “No, I’ll ride it out. It’s FedEx for the next four decades.” “That’s a good plan.” Working late on your birthday, like, “Goddammit, I should have sucked that fuckin’ dick!” [audience laughing] You’ll delete the memory when you’re riding your Jet Ski in the Bahamas. It’s three minutes of your life. Two, if you’re any good. [audience laughing] I would run to that appointment. I would slide on my knees like a catcher going for a pop-up ball. Whip off my mask, be like, “I’m gonna live in Bora Bora!” [audience laughing] Reaching around the back. They didn’t ask for any ass play, but for 50 mil, you’re gettin’ a butt tickle, gratis. [audience laughing] That’s on the house. But I know, even at this point, there are still some straight men in the room that are like, “No.” “Vaginas are great. Dicks are gross.” Here’s how I know you’re full of shit. ‘Cause I jerk off… and so do you. [audience laughing] And when I do, I’m not like… [mouthing words] [audience laughing] There it is again! It’s warm! And there’s a wobble to it. That’s not what I’m doing. I fucking love it. It’s the highlight of my day. I milk it. I literally milk it. [audience laughing] I could finish, but I don’t. Every guy knows what I’m talking about. When you’re like, “Not yet, me.” “Still have some tricks up my sleeve for me, me.” “Ooh, I love it when you treat me like the dirty bitch I am, me.” That is why no one has a right to be homophobic. That’s some backwards and fucked-up shit. [audience cheering] But it’s… Yes. But especially if you are a straight guy and you jerk off, you have no leg to stand on. ‘Cause that’s not just gay, that’s double gay. [audience laughing] If you are a man and you have sex with another man, that’s only one level of gay. If you jerk off, that’s double gay. ‘Cause listen to me. You are giving a man a hand job… while at the exact same time, you are getting a hand job from a man. [audience cheering and applauding] That’s not just gay, that’s double gay. Everybody’s gay. Some of the dudes are looking at me like, “You devil.” [raucous laughter] Guys, thank you so much! What a night! Thank you for being here! Thank you! [upbeat jazz music playing] Peace out!

       " ['Shane Gillis’ debut stand-up comedy special, recorded live at The Creek and The Cave in Austin, TX, offers a blend of edgy, controversial humor and personal anecdotes. Gillis touches on a variety of topics, from his own haircut mishaps to observations on family dynamics, politics, and societal issues. He jokes about his father’s Fox News obsession, racial dynamics in football, and the absurdity of modern social media culture. The special includes candid reflections on his family, like his sister’s struggles with addiction and recovery, and his own experience coaching in the Special Olympics. Gillis also delves into political satire, poking fun at both sides of the political spectrum, and provides irreverent takes on pop culture and current events. His approach mixes dark humor with a candid examination of the absurdities of everyday life. * * * All right, I was thinking about the first time Congress had to come up with an age of consent. Imagine those in powdered wigs, that had to be a rough day for the fellas. It’s like some guy coming up first, like from Rhode Island, “12!” And everyone’s like, “Ew, ew, no dude. I don’t know why I have to go first on this one. It’s like the hardest one to go first on.” [Laughter] This is exciting. I was a little too excited. I panicked and got this haircut. What an insane f*ckup. My hair was fine, totally fine, and then two days ago, I was like, “I gotta salvage this.” It’s crazy that I thought the hair was the issue, like fixing my hair would make me look good. That was the final piece of the puzzle for me. There’s a Dominican barber shop by my house in New York. I think I’m the first white guy that’s ever been in there. I was basically Christopher Columbus of this barber shop. And they f*cked me up, dude. Don’t get a Dominican haircut if you’re white; you end up just looking more racist. It was nice though, he kept trying to reassure me the whole time, “No, man, your head’s good.” I was like, “Oh, thank you, whatever this haircut is. How are you guys?” [Applause] It’s good, it’s good. I’m happy, it’s nice, everybody’s back inside and all that shit. I don’t know, I had a good time. I live in New York, so I left. I went back to my parents’ house because I have white privilege. Some people didn’t get to leave the city, I did, because of my privilege. And I used it. You gotta use it! You know what I mean? Does it feel more disrespectful to waste it? You know what, then we’re all just being racist for nothing. But no, it’s good. I went home. My parents, I haven’t lived with them in over 10 years. They got old. They’re old as f*ck. I’m back on milk. Been f*cking crushing milk lately. I got f*cking milk fat this year. It’s a weird time in life to have a milk renaissance. I’m 33. It was nice. I think my favorite part of the year was watching my dad watch the news. It’s a rough year for my dad and the news. He’s a Fox News guy. Don’t do that. It’s fine. Also, I see you guys, most of you have Fox News dads. How dare you deny your fathers? That’s a good dad. I don’t watch Fox, but that’s a good Fox News mom. That’s fat. You don’t want Fox News mom, that’s a bad mom. She smokes in the house. But a Fox News dad, that’s a good f*cking dad. Can you imagine if you had a f*cking MSNBC dad? There’s some guy every night at dinner like, “We need to start focusing on renewable energy.” It’s like, “Ew, dude, I didn’t know dad was gay, talking to me about solar panels like a f*cking lady.” He might have her straight as hell, dude. We f*cking hate the environment. That’s how straight we are. All we t',\n",
       "  \"alk about is eating pussy and fracking. We hate nature. We go fishing. We don’t even eat fish. We just catch them and f*ck… He’s good, he likes Fox. He watches it every night like every Fox News dad. My dad watches Fox every night until he can’t. That’s how long they watch. They watch every night until they get so angry they have to go to bed. My dad will watch for like two hours and then out of nowhere, he’ll just stand up and be like, “F*cking Mr. Potato Head’s trans, I’m going to bed. This world’s going to hell.” He’s all about it, dude. He loves it. Like every Fox News dad, my dad watches Fox with one goal. He’s just trying to get one fact. That’s all he’s doing. He’s sitting there, trying to retain one piece of information that he can then relay to whoever’s unlucky enough to enter the living room while he’s watching. And you’d think it’d be easy to get one fact, but every once in a while, there’s like a commercial for like a commemorative 9/11 gold coin, just f*cking wipes their hard drive. “What was I watching? I gotta get one of those. I got my hands on those patriotic coins.” [Laughter] My dad drinks too, so he can never get a fact, ever. He’ll come in the living room, we’ll be, he’s hammered, watching the news every night, which is the wildest way to take in world politics. Like, just hammered on a a recliner, like, “Whoa.” It’s like footage of rocket attacks in Israel, he’s like, “Whoa, what the hell are they doing over there? What’s this guy’s problem?” But he can never get a fact. Like, he tries. He uses Fox News as like a PowerPoint for what he’s trying to say. Like, everyone, like, we’ll be eating dinner and like Hannity will be saying something, he’s like, “See that? That’s what I meant. Look at that. That’s me talking. I can’t say it that good.” He can never get a fact. You’ll walk in the living room, he’s been watching the news for three hours, he’ll be like, “Alright, what’s going on in the world?” He’s like, “Do you want to know? I’ll tell you. F*cking Nancy Pelosi is a bitch… All right, settle down, dude.” That was the news last, that’s the news every night from my dad. They’re just like, “Breaking, did you know Nancy Pelosi is a bitch?” I had a feeling. But he likes everything they say. He agrees with it. He’s all in. I realize, like, Fox News is basically Black Church for old white dudes. You know what I mean? Like, literally, everything they say, my dad just, “Say it, like, ‘Yes, preach, Tucker!'” Every once in a while, he gets hit with the Holy Spirit while he’s watching it. The Holy Ghost visits him, he’s just like, “Oh, Lord, build a wall! Can I get a wall?” He needs a wall. My dad needs a wall. For a guy who lives in central Pennsylvania, securing the southern border is oddly important to him. I don’t know what he’s worried about, like he’s going to lose his job. You know, like some guy from Honduras is going to walk the whole way to Pennsylvania, just slam a resume down on my dad’s boss’s desk: “You’re here for the sales position? Stay quiet, also.” I was just at the border of Arizona and Mexico. There’s a wall. I had no idea. I got down there, saw the wall, and I was like, “Holy shit, he built it.” They were like, “No, it’s been here, it’s been here for like a century.” You got to tell my dad. It’ll f*ck him up. He gets fired up every night. It’s a crazy way to go to bed every night, just… So, there’s apnea mask on every night. You walk in the living room in my house right now, my dad, he’d hit you like, “Southern border’s a mess, right?” It’s crazy. But I make fun of him for it, and \",\n",
       "  'then I do the exact same thing, just with my phone. Every night, I just look at my phone until I can’t. I’m like, “Mr. Potato Head’s trans, that’s it.” Every day, I just get on, read opinions from people I know are dumb. Like, in person, I know they’re dumb. I’ve talked to them. I’m still reading their Twitter, their political opinions. It’s great. And my Twitter is crazy. It’s half where I’m from, which is the middle of Pennsylvania, so it’s white trash. And then half, now I live in New York, so it’s crazy, they all got Twitter, they all get f*cking fired up, they have like zero followers and just tweet into the void… They love it, they do it for the love of the game. And now all my new friends, they’re literally communists from Brooklyn. So it’s wild, dude. My social, like, I’ll get on Twitter, and the first tweet I see will be someone from back home that’s just like, “F*cking Colin Kaepernick better stand up. Like this tweet if you support the police, share it if you’re not gay.” “I’m like, f*ck it, I’m sharing that.”And then the next post is just one of my new woke white friends that’s just like, “I’m not racist.” That’s it. Every day, for the last year, just a different white person popping up, like, “Look at me, look at this article I shared to my Instagram story. I’m not racist, right?” It’s like, “Alright, are you sure?” I don’t know if you know this, like being racist isn’t like a yes or no thing. You know what I mean? It’s not like you have it or you don’t have it. Being racist is more, it’s like being hungry. You know, it’s like, “Yeah, you’re not hungry right now. But a cheeseburger could cut you off on the highway, you get hungry.” We’re hungry all day. The cheeseburger is Jewish in that joke. No, okay. Cheeseburgers, whatever, whatever type of cheeseburger you thought it was in your racist heart. Anyway. That’s it. I just get online, read opinions from people. The news, like other news, is kind of like, “This is the most divided this country has ever been,” say with the, like, the red states and the blue states. It’s like, “Why? Because we tweet at each other?” You know, we had a war, right? You know, this country had a Civil War. That was pretty divided. Like, at least nowadays, we’re communicating with each other. Back then, those guys never… They got the news like once a month. Some guy would come by on a horse, and they were like, “Who’s talking shit?” The guy was like, “The South is talking shit.” “F*ck that, I don’t like that. Give me my gun. I’m gonna go down there. I’m gonna walk down there for a month straight, shoot the first f*cking guy I see down there.” The Civil War was basically just the North just shooting racism out of the South. That’s what happened. The North was like, “South, f*cking chill.” And the South was like, “No.” So a bunch of guys had to walk down there and shoot them a lot. And they’re like, “Alright, we’ll let them go, but we are not gonna be nice to them for a while until we find out they’re good at football and then, Roll Tide.” [Laughter] Yeah, “Roll Damn Tide.” I don’t like Alabama football. I watched this documentary on Alabama football. It’s great. It’s about… Well, it’s not… I don’t know if you should say it’s great. But it’s about Alabama football. It’s about when they desegregated their football team. So, up until this point, Alabama football was just white, alright? And everybody down there was pumped about that. They would pack the stadium, everyone would be like, “Look at all those whites running around, catching it.” Hey, look, I’m not knocking them too har',\n",
       "  'd because I still have a little bit of that in me. You know, like if a white guy catches the ball on Sunday, I’m like, “Oh shit, go, go, go, go, go! Ah, they got him. They got him. It’s a tough run, a smart run, heads up run there.” But no, they took it too far. And uh, so the documentary focuses on that. It focuses on Bear Bryant. Bear Bryant, legendary head coach. He was the head coach that brought the first black players onto the team. So the whole documentary is like celebrating Bear Bryant. They’re like, “F*cking way to go, Bear. You did it. What a hero.” And then you find out it was 1971. Yeah, well, a little late for high fives on this one, fellas. Holy shit, 71? Like, we had been to the moon. There were literally people on the moon before Alabama had black guys in their secondary. [Laughter] Does anyone understand? There were white corners. White cornerbacks. You understand how preposterous that is? Some of you are too young to have ever even seen a white corner. They’re extinct. They don’t exist. There are two left at the San Diego Zoo. They won’t reproduce. You’ll never see a white corner. But that’s what happened. It wasn’t like… The reason they desegregated the team it was — that’s what the documentary focuses on, which is great — because it wasn’t like\\xa0 “Oh hey, fellas. It’s 1971. Maybe we should get with the times.” What happened was Alabama scheduled USC, Southern Cal. Alabama was confident. They’re like, “Oh, white boys will take on anybody and then USC came down to Alabama with a bunch of black dudes from L.A. and just beat the f*ck out of Alabama. And then after the game, Bear Bryant gave like a speech, and he was like, “Hey, y’all, come on.” That was it. That’s all it took. Everybody down there was like, “Yeah, we get it. We’ll be less racist if it means we can win.” What? That’s what it is. Like, as big as racism is in America, football, that’s true. That’s true. Look, the GOAT. There’s a Disney movie, Remember the Titans, dedicated to what I just told you. The whole point of that movie was one high school football season. Remember the Titans was like, eight weeks. You know, that whole town went from like centuries of like, “Don’t let them in our school,” to just like, “Oh shit, the high school team’s 4-0. Those are my brothers.” [Laughter] All right, I’ll get off the topic. The point I’m trying to make, the point I’m trying to make is, if you want to get rights in America, you just gotta put together a good football team. You know what I mean? Like, if the transgenders got together and put together just a f*cking hard-nose, run-it-down-your-throat ball club, the trans, just three yards and a cloud of dust of transgenders, if the trans community could just somehow upset Alabama, everybody down there tomorrow would be like, “Those are some tough bitches… actually, right.” [Applause] All right, we got out of that. There are some rough patches in there. That’s all right. Well, this won’t go great either. [Laughter] You know how like every show and movie now, it’s like a remake of something? They just remake an old thing and just make it more progressive and just put it out. Like, they remade Ocean’s 11, like a heist movie, with all gorgeous women. That movie should have been 10 minutes long. They literally should have got to the casino and just blown the security guards. They’d be like, “Here are the keys to the safe. Take everything. I love you. You guys, you crazy bitches. I love you bitches.” It’s just… That’s all they make. They either make that or they make slavery movies every year. Those ar',\n",
       "  \"e for no one. I have black friends. I was like, “Dude, you guys like these?” They’re like, “No, we thought these were for you.” Like, “No, we all hate those.” Stop making them. It’s uncomfortable. Civil Rights movies are good, though. I like, like Judas and the Black Messiah was sick. Remember the Titans is great. Hidden Figures was the movie about the black ladies at NASA, or as my dad likes to call it, “Medea Goes to the Moon.” Look, that was him that said that. He said that. As soon as he said it, I was like, “What did you f*cking say? You don’t talk like that.” So every movie is just remade, more progressive. I just think it’d be funny if, like, the right started remaking, you know what I mean? If they just start, like, conservatives, like, there’s a new Scooby-Doo coming out. And it’d be funny if, like, the right remade it. It’s just like Scooby and the gang going around ripping the wigs off of transgender people. It’s like, “That’s not a woman!” Some guy, “I would have got away with it.” “We solved the case of the Starbucks ghoul.” [Laughter] Has enough time passed that we can admit that Trump was funny? Can we finally admit that? He was funny. Well, hold on, I don’t like the tone on that, that’s not what I’m going for here. “Yeah, the great leader…” He was funny. Now, whether or not that’s a great quality for the Commander-in-Chief, that’s definitely up for debate. But he was funny. I saw it. And I lived in New York, so the whole time he was in office, I would be like, you know, something would happen, I’d show my friends, like, “Look at that.” They’d be like, “What? It’s funny, okay? There’s nothing funny about Donald Trump.” I don’t… I don’t know. During Hurricane Dorian, he was like, “Maybe we should nuke it.” Like, that was a real suggestion from the president. The president of the United States. He was like, “Hey, we got a big storm coming. You guys want me to blow it up?” And I was like, “No, what the f*ck are you talking about?” “I don’t know, I just f*ck around dude. That’s what I do.” I don’t know. Now that he’s gone, I’ll never watch a debate ever again. Can you imagine, like, just a regular debate now, after we went like… We witnessed the GOAT, undefeated in debates, and he never said a fact. You know how impressive that is? He was funny, and he argued like a fifth grader. He was unstoppable. People tried to hit him with statistics and facts, he would just go, “Wrong.” Holy f*ck, dude. How is no one prepared for this? Go back and watch those debates. You forget how good, how electric that shit was. Don’t tell your friends in Austin, they’ll be mad. Just get a six-pack, toss on a Trump highlight video on YouTube. It’s a good night, dude. Why, I went back. I watched his first debate. That’s like my favorite one. At the time, Trump was pulling at like less than one percent. Like, he was nobody. If you guys like him now, you didn’t back then. And I know that because my dad, my dad at the time, any time Trump even came on TV, my dad was like, “Get this f*cking joker off the screen.” And then now, my dad’s like, “Guys can’t go to the Capitol? He’s like, ‘Guys can’t have fun anymore?'” It was because of the debates. That’s what did it, dude. That’s how we got Trump, these debates. And the first one is the best one. So it’s a Republican primary, everyone’s up on stage, and they’re all still doing their political shit So like the first couple of guys that talk are like, “I’m from Kentucky, and I love education.” And the crowd’s like, “Nice, we didn’t know what was coming.” Then the next guy’s like, “I’m f\",\n",
       "  \"rom Georgia, and I love religion.” The crowd’s like, “Pretty good, this is a good one.” It was a heated debate. And then it finally got to Trump’s turn to talk, and he was just like, “Rand Paul is ugly.” And the whole crowd was like, “Oh, we didn’t know you could do that in this. You can just do that as your thing?” And Rand Paul was like, “Alright everybody, settle down. We’re trying to have a debate here.” And the whole crowd was like, “Shut the f*ck up, Rand Paul. Ugly bitch!” And we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make him debate Trump. It was not fair. It was mean for us to have done that to people. These guys were in politics their whole lives, and they just had to debate a f*cking maniac up there who didn’t give a f*ck. And I hated him, but it was fun to cheer for him in the debates. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates because, dude, he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years, and then he showed up to the event like, “Oh f*ck, what are we talking about?” He had no clue. Every week, he had no f*cking idea. There’s one debate, there’s one debate, he’s like in the middle of it, going back and forth about the economy with Ted Cruz. They’re literally talking about the economy, and in the middle of it, he’s just like, “Ted’s wife is ugly as a dog.” Holy shit, dude. Ted was like, “I’m from Texas, you don’t talk about a man’s family like that.” And Trump’s like, “You’ve got a dog wife, Ted. Everyone knows.” Yeah, and a week later, Ted Cruz was on TV like, “I support Donald J…” He’s like, “You pussy” I will say this, the one thing that sucked about Trump losing was, for me, it was because I just figured out kind of how to do his voice. That’s kind of a bummer. It’s not hard to do Trump. It’s very… all you have to do, do that, do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence, and then all you… like, you don’t have to sound like him, all you have to do is get his cadence down. It’s very easy. All you have to do is describe something and then say you described it that way. That’s it. It’s every time, like, “What a big room this is. I walked in here, I said, ‘Wow, what a big room.'” [Applause] “Austin, a lot of homeless. I walked in here, I said, ‘Wow, that’s a lot of homeless’.” You guys got it. You got a lot of homeless. What are you guys doing about it? Whatever you guys are doing is not working. So cheap. Switch, I don’t know what to do either, but do something. “A lot of tents.” [Laughter] “Why?” It’s been making me laugh, thinking about Trump, like not understanding why people are homeless. “I walked out, I saw them, I said, ‘Why are you living in tents?’ I could never. These guys…” But I will say this about Trump, I don’t want you guys to get… I don’t want to turn this into a rally. I will say this, so don’t freak out, just listen. I will… I think it’s fair to say that of all the presidents we’ve had, I think it’s fair to say that Trump would have been the funniest one to see get shot. You know, dude, the patriots got fired up on that. Dude, I was having fun at this show. No, look, I didn’t even say it would be funny. I said funniest. It’s a huge difference. Technically, there’s the funniest of everything. There is. It doesn’t make it funny, but there is, like, think of the worst thing you can think of. There’s a funniest one. I’ll go first. I’ll think of one. School shooting. None of those are funny. Zero funny. But maybe there was one where, like, the horse girl in the class, like, could sense something was coming. You know what I mean? They’re like, “Wha\",\n",
       "  \"t’s wrong?” And she was like… [Laughter] But back to what I was saying about, if you had… What I said was true. If you had to rank them, from least funny to funniest assassination, easy, number one. Really. He’d be talking shit, like, when it happened, he’d be doing like a rally, “My opponent’s gay. I walked in, I saw him, I said, ‘Wow, this guy’s gay.’ ” The shooter would be coming out, “Sit down. You’re gay.” Get hit. He’d definitely make a funny noise into the… Like, he’d get hit, fall funny. I will say, I did write that joke before Biden could be added to the rankings. I don’t think he would be the funniest, but the only reason Biden might be the funniest is because I think Biden’s the first president you could punch assassinate. You know what I mean? Just walk right up through the metal, “Texas, Mr. President, the hell are you doing, dude?” It’s a body shot. [Laughter] I’d add that joke… My dad’s… “He can’t be talking about killing presidents.” What about body… Music. My dad’s… He’s a good guy. He’s an alcoholic, but he’s good. He’s like a good alcoholic. He’s not hurting anybody. But everyone’s, he’s always got an excuse for why he’s drinking. That’s what’s funny about it. Like, he can never just get hammered and be like, “Yeah, I got f*cked up.” It’s always like, “You’ll see him on like a Monday, you’ll be like, ‘Damn, it’s Monday, you’re getting f*cked up?’ He’s like, ‘It’s Monday Night Football. Have a couple of drinks, geez.'” You’ll see him on like a Tuesday, you’ll be like, “Damn, it’s Tuesday, you’re getting f*cked up?” He’s like, “It’s Tuesday. There’s no football.” [Music] What the hell. And my sister does heroin, and uh, and that one, we’re like, “You do need to stop doing that.” Which sucks for her because if she played guitar, everybody would be like, “She’s a genius.” Instead, she’s a hairdresser, so it’s not as cool. Relax, it’s my family. It’s my family. Don’t worry about it. Actually, based on this crowd, I’m sure it’s actually a lot of your guys’ families too. And that’s all right. We’re allowed to talk about it. My sister, since she was doing heroin, we had to have an intervention for her. She lived out in Pittsburgh. We live in the middle of Pennsylvania. So we had to trick her to come home. You got to trick them. I don’t know if you know these guys, they’re not just f*cking stopping by. They’re very busy. They’re the busiest people. They get a bad rap for being lazy because they take a lot of naps. But if they’re awake, they’re f*cking…very busy. They’re scurrying around, dude, doing quests. That’s what they do. If you do heroin long enough, you run out of money. You got to start doing quests. You know, it’s… You know, it’s like a f*cked up game of Zelda every day. You just wake up to a new quest. It’s like, “You need to gather coppers. Gonna find a scrap yard.” It sounds nice. I wish I got quests. But eventually, the quests get pretty dark. Scrapyard, that’s like level one. Towards the end, the quest, you need to get titty behind the Home Depot. [Laughter] It’s when it’s time for a change. So we had to come up with a plan to trick her to come home for the intervention. The plan we came up with was we told her that we had won tickets to go to Six Flags. And it worked. She called back, she’s already, “Alright, I’ll be there.” Just got on the first bus. It’s like a seven-hour bus ride. There’s nothing to them, dude. No, if you take heroin, every bus is a bullet train. It’s a five-minute ride, tops. Anyway, so the plan was, pick my sister up from the bus stop, not take her to Six Flags. They\",\n",
       "  \" could take her to a hotel, where we’re gonna have an intervention. I didn’t want to start the intervention with like a lack of trust, so I took her to Six Flags the day of her intervention. The morning of that day, she and I went to Six Flags together. And I thought that was a nice gesture, but it turns out an intervention is supposed to be rock bottom. You know what I mean? Like, an intervention’s supposed to be the worst day of your life, not like you’re tired from easily the best day humanly possible. I mean, she took heroin and rode roller coasters. It was… Dude, it was impossible. We sat down with her, like, “You better\\xa0 f*cking change your life.” She’s like, “I’m going back tomorrow.” And I was with her. She was… She was f*cked up. If you know anyone from Pittsburgh, you know what she was wearing. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Steelers pajama pants. She dusted off her finest Hines Ward for the occasion. [Laughter] So we get in there, there’s a water park there. We didn’t know they added that. We haven’t been there since we were kids. We get in there, there’s one of those water slides, it’s just like a f*cking straight drop. No sides on it, no raft, just by yourself. She looks at it, she’s like, “I wanna go up on that one.” I was like, “Yeah, alright, yeah, f*ck it… you know, I knew she was going to rehab like that night, so I was like, ‘Yeah, get this one in. You’re gonna have a rough couple of months here.'” Also, I figured they would stop her. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants, trying to get on a water slide. All they did was make her take her f*cking crocs off. Her yellow crocs. So she’s climbing up this ladder, she gets to the top of this f*cking giant water slide. You like when it’s your turn next on a water ride, you got to lay there in that water and wait to go? She nodded off. She took a nap, up at the top, like a Dracula, laying in front of some high school lifeguard that’s like, “Uh, ma’am, it’s your turn.” He just sent her down, asleep, just flying down this thing, dude. There’s a ramp at the end. She hit it, and we all got to watch her wake up in mid-air. She did the whole f*cking… I don’t know how that wasn’t f*cking rock bottom. So, you woke up in mid-air. Anyway, don’t be sad about it. She’s good. She did go to rehab, and that’s good. Yeah, she’s done. She stopped using. She’s sober. She’s all good. Two years clean. [Applause] Yeah, yeah, it’s good. She did… Uh, she did get cancer, though. So… And COVID. Cancer and COVID. So, I’ll tell you what, this was cool. I got… I was with her. I was with her. She was at home. She went back to my parents’ house because when you have cancer and COVID, you got to go home. You can’t keep hanging out. But no, I was with her. It was crazy. She… This year, she beat heroin, cancer, and COVID. It was like living with Rocky. It was crazy, dude. Every week, my whole family was like, “Give up. You’re never gonna win this.” She’s like… Just kept winning. When she got COVID, I was like, “Alright, you’re definitely dead.” “I ain’t hear no bell.” Just wailed on it, dude. Yeah, she’s got a hell of a chin. A hell of a chin on my sister. And what better quality could you ask for in a human? Anyway… Damn, dudes. F*ck that music across the street, dude, that f*cking bothers me. I’m an old man now. “Turn it down. Okay, now what is that? Rap? Turn it off. Gotta talk about my sister doing heroin over here!” This has been making me laugh. I’ve been thinking about like the first time, uh… Like, uh, Jesus Christ. I do comedy a lot, and every\",\n",
       "  ' once in a while, you can hear music from another room. And it’s like, “Damn, dude, music’s so much better.” Every time I hear music, I’m like, “F*ck dude, that crushes what I do.” Some idiot dressed like Cam Newton pressing play. It’s so much better than this. You guys want to hear about my problems? This guy’s like, “Take Molly, finger someone. I’m gonna press play. You guys do you.” F*ck they’re having so much fun over there. Get the f*ck out of here, go dance. I knew you wanted to dance. That guy wanted to dance all night. Alright, I like my family. It’s a good family. I had to go to my niece’s 7th and 8th grade girls’ volleyball match recently. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding, dude. Shut up. Just relax. I don’t want to f*ck kids, but if you ever want to get out of something, that’s all you have to do. Like, if your friend’s like, “Do you want to come to our son’s T-ball game?” Be like, “What grade are the kids in?” And then, no matter what they say, go, “Fourth?” [Laughter] No, I went to this f*cking kids’ volleyball match. Can we knock it off with volleyball shorts on little kids? It’s weird. It’s gross, dude. Just get them gym shorts. That’s all. No, dude, it’s gross because then, you know, it’s just me and the other uncles up in the… up in the bleachers, kind of making eye contact with each other like, “Bro, are you seeing this?” [Laughter] Such a funny way to just destroy a show, just right at the very end, be like, “Aren’t kids hot? Yo, give it up for Trump. Aren’t kids hot?” No, I am. I truly am serious about the gym shorts, though. It’s weird. And so I got home from this f*cking volleyball match. My roommate, his girlfriend played college volleyball. So I’m very excited to, like, shit on volleyball whenever I can. So I get in there, and I was like, “Yo, volleyball is f*cking…, that’s a weird culture. Get them f*cking shorts. Get them gym shorts. The shorts they’re wearing is gross.” And she was like, “No, we need those shorts for speed on the court.” And I was like, “Uh, I know that’s not true. I watched the NBA. None of you are moving as fast as like a ref, and those guys are wearing like slacks, dress shoes, for some reason.” She was like, “No, we need those shorts. The tight shorts, they’re essential.” She compared them to like a helmet in football. I was like, “I know they’re not essential because I Googled the Special Olympics volleyball team.” [Laughter] All of a sudden, those shorts weren’t so essential for them. What’s that about? How baggy do you think they’re… They look like the f*cking AND1 Mixtape out there. Offensively baggy is how I would describe all of their attires. [Laughter] We’re all adults. We can… This, we all agree the Special Olympics is a good… It’s a good program. I just… It’s great. I just feel like the guy who came up with it had to be like a real risk-taker. You know what I mean? That’s a wild thing to suggest for the first time. Some guy in a board meeting like, “I got an idea. We should be racing these motherf*ckers.” Like, “What’d you say?” “Uh, town over said that they’re the fastest ones. Say we settle it, you know?” I’m not making fun of the Olympians. The concept is wild. It’s a wild, like, if your best friend invented the Special Olympics and told you about it first, you’d be like, “Don’t ever tell anybody that. Who the f*ck are you going to tell that to? What are you doing? Pole vault?” [Laughter] I actually, personally, I actually volunteered and coached with the Special Olympics for a little while. So, you know what? You guys do… No, don’t clap, please. I did it for',\n",
       "  ' those kids. [Applause] I look like this, so me coaching the Special Olympics, I was like a f*cking double agent. No one knew whose side I was on, dude. Player, chaperone, no one knew. I’d be standing there coaching, holding a clipboard, with five dudes that looked exactly like me. I always see the coaches from the other team looking over like, “I think they got… I think they’re f*cking letting one of them coach.” Yeah, no, I did coach the Special Olympics for a little while. And it’s fun. That’s another thing, you’re allowed to talk about it. It’s happy, everyone there’s sportsmanship. It is funny. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not funny, dude. I was there. Everyone there is laughing. It’s fun. I coached basketball. Kids would catch the ball, just launch it into the bleachers. People be like “What the f*ck are you doing out there?” My whole team ruled. Everybody, every dude on my team, they were the funniest. They were bros. They’re bros, dude. My whole team loved two things: they love tits, they do. I don’t know if you know these guys, dude. They f*cking love the ladies. And they love John Cena. That’s it. That was the news every day. We’d be in the huddle, they’d be like, “A lot of ladies here tonight.” I was like, “Yeah.” They’d be like, “What do you think John Cena is up to?” “Oh, you’re gonna have to get way worse before you meet him.” See, he’s just like the angel of death for those guys. I told my guys, I was like, “You see Cena coming, you get the f*ck out of there. He’s taking souls with him.” [Laughter] Every year, Hooters would sponsor our one basketball tournament. Alright? So, every year, Hooters would bring like three or four waitresses, and they would present like a big cardboard check donation to the Special Olympics. As soon as the girls entered the gym, the game changed entirely, dude. It went from like hugs and sportsmanship to just like dudes got competitive. Like very competitive. F*cking ripping down rebounds, just hitting layups. [Laughter] And then at the end of the game, there’d be a hug line, you know, between the waitresses and the players. And yeah, that went about exactly how you would imagine that went. We had to break out the f*cking jaws of life, dude. My boys, my boys were ragging on those young sluts. And I’m not knocking the players. They were totally in the right. The girls were hot. The waitresses, like every year, I would sneak into the hug line myself. Alright, I think I’m going to get out of here, guys. Thank you guys very much. This was a lot of fun. Thank you. [Applause] [Music] * * * \\n\\n Your email address will not be published.

       " ['Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And ',\n",
       "  'I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!” My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexica',\n",
       "  'n people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He propos',\n",
       "  'ed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitall',\n",
       "  \"y stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.” My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put \",\n",
       "  'it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!” ♪ A whole new world ♪ It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.” I’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American broth',\n",
       "  'ers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the T',\n",
       "  \"upac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!” I don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck \",\n",
       "  'up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.” I can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be ',\n",
       "  'considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy. You know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin. So, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

       " ['Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits… Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn’t it cra',\n",
       "  \"zy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot. Yeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” And don’t get me wrong. Don’\",\n",
       "  't get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four ch',\n",
       "  'ildren. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.” I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking',\n",
       "  ' through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend. I’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny. I think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It’s okay, peop',\n",
       "  'le hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.” My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been re',\n",
       "  'ading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.” Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right?',\n",
       "  ' Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim ',\n",
       "  'shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?” No. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise u',\n",
       "  \"p. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.” This might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better. This man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime Except for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.  Great material. So a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician’s son falling to his death isn’t?  Where are your priorities? They’re just jokes.

       " ['[cheers and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have the nerve to',\n",
       "  ' open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports br',\n",
       "  'a, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back thre',\n",
       "  'e days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll mo',\n",
       "  've you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically n',\n",
       "  'ever hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen T',\n",
       "  'V. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up.',\n",
       "  ' Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna g',\n",
       "  'et crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You ',\n",
       "  'just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen. I don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!” This went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare. That would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that. I’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which',\n",
       "  ' really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones. It doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots. Everybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off. I’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’',\n",
       "  're doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell. It’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear. A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear. Uh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited. I knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars. And then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…” And then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the t',\n",
       "  'rash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.” He was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them. I know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out. The second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that. Some people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you',\n",
       "  '’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect. We’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was. But if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated. And then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off. If Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit. You know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in. Somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife’s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.” They’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, “Man, I miss Bruce.” I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t ',\n",
       "  'know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening? Wait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, “How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?” If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.” The third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of Chappelle’s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.“ And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.” Well, you young heads missed that shit. You’re all too young. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike. I remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the c',\n",
       "  'lassroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us. My point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way. I used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest. However, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, “When did everyone get mad?” And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.” And then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question t',\n",
       "  'he very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too. The ’70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on… Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure. Yeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer!” I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works. Can’t do comparative suffering. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian. Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t',\n",
       "  ' believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough. You guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true. “♪ Got everything, I got everything ♪\\n♪ I cannot complain, I cannot ♪\\n♪ I don’t even know How much I really made ♪\\n♪ I forgot, it’s a lot ♪\\n♪ Fuck that, never mind what I got ♪” And his wife will be like, “Kevin, come to bed!” He’ll be like… “♪ Ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ I got way too much– ♪” You know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have “Quiet, please” money at best. I’d have to take a loan out for “Shut the fuck up.” “Shut the fuck up–” That’s Jay Z money. And Beyoncé got “No, you shut the fuck up” money. Let’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show tha',\n",
       "  't got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much!

This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that.

       " ['[Car horn honks] [Audience cheering] [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Jim Jefferies! [Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that’s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I’m at the end of the tour right now. I’m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So… [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she’s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and I’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and I don’t see it getting better. Um… I’ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “Oh, I used to party with Madonna.” And I went, “You fucking what, when?” And she went, “I used to party with Madonna.” Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I’m not bragging. I didn’t get the model years. I didn’t get those years. I’ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um… So, I said, “So you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” And she went, “No, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” I go, “You need to elaborate on this story right now.” And she goes, “Oh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.” As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, “That’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” That’s a big one. “That’s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.” So she said, “I used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna’s house.” And she goes, “This one time, the four of us were over at Madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” And then I went, “Shut the fuck up!” And she went, “What?” I said, “I know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! You all started fucking each other!” And she went, “We did. We started…” “Just shut up!” And she goes, “What do you care for?” I said, “You’re the mother of my child! I don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ NBA player while you’re licking out Madonna’s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…” [Moaning] And she goes, “Oh, you’re being silly. What do you care for? You’ve partied way more than I have in my life.” And I went, “That is not true. I’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn’t call it a party.” For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It’s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We’re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, “Well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.” [Chuckles] I don’t… You know, I’ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I’ve had good nights out, but I’ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? I’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It’s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just… They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they’re going, “No, dude. Use the table. Don’t use your…” And I go, “Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um…” And it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring ’em in like, “Huh?” And you can do this. You can go… “Uh…” Like that. And they’ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.” When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.” And that’s a vastly different emotion that… I don’t think women will never… Yeah, okay. This is the thing. In America, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “And still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” And of course, that’s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like… a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don’t actually mean, but this is something I’m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I’m sorry. I… [Audience whooping] I’m not being a misogynistic',\n",
       "  ' bastard, right? I’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. I’m sure they do. I’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. What I’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now… I’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “Oh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.” And don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. Right? We do. But there’s little things in society that you can’t change. Men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. There’s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine’s Day is just for women. They say it’s for romantics. They say it’s for couples or something like that. It’s just for women. There’s no man who gets excited by Valentine’s Day. There’s no man that when he sees the Valentine’s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “Oh, Valentine’s Day is coming!” Valentine’s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “How much money do I have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” It doesn’t stop there. Mother’s Day! Mother’s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend’s first Mother’s Day. And she went, “Oh, I wonder what I’ll get for Mother’s Day.” And I went, “Probably fucking nothing. He’s got no money. He’s six months old. What do you think he’s gonna buy you?” Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother’s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause I assumed that’s what Hank would have wanted her to have… and I wrote a card. I’m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I’m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] “Happy Mother’s Day. Love, Hank.” And I went, “H-A-N…” And then I did the “K” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. See, now I know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “Well, fathers have Father’s Day.” Father’s Day is bullshit. It’s fucking shit, Father’s Day. Father’s Day came around and my girlfriend went, “What do you want for Father’s Day?” And I went, “I don’t want anything. Don’t even worry about it. I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on. You gotta have something.” I said, “Honestly, I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on.” And I went, “It’s my fucking money. Just don’t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.” That’s why every single father has that one Father’s Day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! It’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “I heart Dad.” And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go… “That cost me nothing, that mug.” [Audience whooping] See… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I’ve got it, right? April 18th… Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It’s good, isn’t it? Everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It’s nice. A month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “Oh, the decorations are up!” [Men whooping] And it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine’s Day when they don’t get a gift. You could go like, “Oh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. They’ve, uh…” I’m thinking, I don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I’m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting “Jim Jefferies” on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, “April 18th.” ‘Cause it’s good, right? You’re in a bar. You’re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go… Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt. The weird thing is I’m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I’m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it’s a much more… I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex… Oh, you know… I do it. I get involved, ’cause I feel like I have to. You know, I… But I’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh… When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… But the thing is, you can’t smell porn. You don’t smell porn. You just… You just watch it. They never… And it’s different, porn. It’s different. They clean the girl’s asshole. They pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. I’m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She’s like… You’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “Put it in my ass.” She’s inviting. It’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. And then she’s like… She says things… I don’t know, things like, “I’m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.” And… And the experience I’ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I’ve… My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… It’s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “I’m gonna act like I enjoy it.” She does that whole, “Yeah. Oh, no, that’s good.” [Moaning] Ahh! ♪ I’m having a good time ♪ And then they’re always going, “Are you done? Are you close to done?” You never fuck a pussy and they go, “',\n",
       "  'Are you almost done? Finish this.” Like that. If you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don’t know how much they get paid. I’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. It’s the opposite bit of society. Um… But they do a thing called “ATM.” I don’t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for “ass to mouth.” That’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “I love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.” And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work… [Applause] she’s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. Now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “Well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?” [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering] So… I’m a father. Um… I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. He’s a good little boy. No, he’s a great little fella. I really like him. Um… My girlfriend super loves him, though. It’s fucking creepy. And… I’m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn’t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn’t fuck it. I… I just don’t get along with women. You know how it is. I don’t want them in my house, and… So… Because you dream, see… For example, okay? When Hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “Aw, that’s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.” That’s what I think… ‘Cause that’s what I think about my son. I hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. I don’t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “Oh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you’re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” Right, you know… And it’s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. They’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it’s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “Uh, uh!” Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, “Everyone, my boyfriend’s here. Here’s my boyfriend. Give him here. He’s my boyfriend.” And then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ It’s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl… Let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “Hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. Give her here. Give her here. She’s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She’s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don’t worry about a thing.” [Applause] [Cheering] So… Also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It’s just little things. Even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. There’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. I don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. ‘Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don’t give a shit. Fucking… My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I’ve got shit on my dick, I’ll ring me mate Jason up and go, “Hey, Jason… It’s happened again. I got shit on my dick.” And he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “Oh, I can’t wait to call Karen.” [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you… When my girlfriend got pregnant… When you meet… When you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like, “It is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.” And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “You’re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It’s over.',\n",
       "  ' You’re not gonna sleep.” They’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I’ve had girlfriends. That’s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “Fuck it! Let’s have a kid.” Fucking did it, right? These other people, man… You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “We’re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?” And you wanna say, “No, you’re really boring and we hate you.” But you go, “Oh, okay, great. You’re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.” And… And then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “We have to see how our careers are going and shit.” And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “From our family to yours.” And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “What the fuck is this shit?” And they’re like, “We had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.” And you go, “Well, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control…” And then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “What’s happening? A new person.” And they’re like, “Fuck off. We don’t love you anymore. We’re going.” And they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you’re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I’m not saying ’cause they look the same. I’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going… “Yolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.” [Jeffries chuckles] I’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh… Gun control. Now… No, wait. Before you… Don’t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, “Yeah! Do it, Jim!” No, let’s just… [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I’m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the… Oh, it doesn’t matter. I don’t like guns, right? I’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn’t been beaten. And… Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. I don’t know how or why this happened, uh… Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, “That’s it! No more guns!” And we all went, “Yeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.” Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “Maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my guns!” [Whooping] So, here’s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It’s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “Fuck off. I like guns.” It’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. And there’s nothing wrong with it. There’s nothing wrong with saying, “I like something. Don’t take it away from me.” But don’t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] “I need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.” Really? Is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? Is it? I’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, “Well, that’d never happen to me.” You don’t know that, because you know what?\\n♪ From time to time We all get sad ♪ \\n♪ One day you’re happy Then you’re sad ♪ \\n♪ And then, uh-oh ♪\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] “Well, imagine if you had a gun.” And I’m like, “All right. I was naked at the time. I wasn’t wearing my holster. I wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.” What world do you live in where you’re const',\n",
       "  \"antly fucking ready? You have guns ’cause you like guns! That’s why you go to gun conventions! That’s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “Fucking yeah!” Like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, “That’d never happen in my house ’cause I’m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.” Then they’re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you’re like, “Wait there, fuck-face! Oh! You’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I’m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother’s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother’s birthday? Maybe if you didn’t leave the window open [In whining voice] ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, “None of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” I… I think they’re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] “Oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” And then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “You’re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.” Then she’d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “Why don’t they like me?” Let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, “Oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” They go, “We’ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.” Yeah, that’ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and… [Mimicking machine gun] And you’ve got Kevin. Now, I’m sure Kevin’s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don’t agree with me. Don’t think I don’t. Out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They’re looking around, going, “Wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” And then… there’s the last 10%. And they’re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. Just… And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I’m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “If you don’t like it, go home! If you don’t like it, go home!” And my answer to that is, “No.” I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I’ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And… unless you’re an American Indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It’s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don’t know what it says. I’ve never seen it. If there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. And don’t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had… Fucking, I get it, right? I’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I’m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] “You cannot change the Second Amendment!” And I’m like, “Yes, you can. It’s called an ‘amendment.'” If you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don’t think your constitution is set in stone. You’ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, “Hey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let’s get that one out. Let’s get that one out.” You used to have this other thing in America called, uh… slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, “That’s it. No more slaves!” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my slaves!” And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “Why should I have my slaves taken off me? I’m a responsible slave owner. I’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I… I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!” That’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me? I’\",\n",
       "  've done nothing wrong.” Look, I agree with you. If you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that’s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! “Oh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.” Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can’t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “Thanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” See, that’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me, I’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” Who’s to say you’re not crazy? That’s the thing about crazy people. They don’t know they’re crazy. That’s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, “I think, therefore I am.” You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that’s it. Right now, I think I’m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That’s what I think I’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] “I hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.” [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, “Well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It’ll be delivered to your house. That’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. You’ve got $34,000. You’re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger’s as fuck. Right? I don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] “Guns! Who wants to sell me a gun?” Now, I’m gonna wrap this up. We won’t talk about it anymore. Now… See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with… That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. – [Audience cheering] – Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You’re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I’m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets… Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what’s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “Fuck you, buddy! Ah, you’re not a bad guy. You’re all right.” Now… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause I don’t behave myself in there, so I’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘Cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like… Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That’s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “Hey, ladies. He’s a fireman.” And he comes out with his hose and like that… And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “You can’t take care of your kids.” It’s… And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don’t know… I don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. There’s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… That’s what a private “dance” is, right? I don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can’t imagine that there would be. I don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… She goes, “How was it?” And she goes, “Well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.” So Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. It was… I’m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn’t… Now… The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I u',\n",
       "  'sed to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He’s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now… the great thing about DJ is… he already looks disabled. He has that “latter stages of AIDS” thing going on. It’s great for casting. Anyway, but… I didn’t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors’ Union of America said, “You cannot do that.” Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, “All right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, “Can you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?” So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don’t know why. Maybe they’re just lazy. They don’t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I’d ever seen in my life. He was like… Think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of… [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and I’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, “Thank you so much for coming in.” And then we did the dialog together, and I didn’t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, “That’s our guy. That’s who we gotta pick.” And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought… “If he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” So he comes in… He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, “Whoa! What’s going on there, kicky?” And he goes… “Oh, you got me! I’m not disabled.” And I said, “You’re fucking what now?” And he goes, “I’m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.” And I said, “Just shut up. So let me… This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” And he went… “Yeah.” And I said, “You’re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.” And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and I’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and I just think, “I’m gonna call this guy up. I’m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?” And I’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like… And I thought, “This has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” The shutter on his camera has gotta be like… [Mimicking camera shutter] Like… [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “This guy’s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!” Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I’m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “Ta-da!” And we would have gone, “That was very good.” But I’ll tell you what you don’t do. Don’t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, “You did very good.” He’s like, “Thank you, Jim.” [Laughing] [Chuckles] I was, uh… I go to a therapist… ’cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “I’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, “Red,” and I went, “Blue.” And then she went, “Cooking,” and I went, “Food,” and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went… For the last question, she went, “And what’s your favorite thing in the world?” And I went… “Coming on a girl’s face.” Now… Now, I could’ve said things like… “Ice cream” is a good answer. “Hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. But I said, “Coming on a girl’s face.” And I’ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. – I… – [Cheering] I’m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It’s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl’s on her knees and you… It’s so… And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin',\n",
       "  ' and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, “When a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” There was never that… never that moment. But, by golly, if it’s not fun. I find it… To… Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, “Bravo!” Don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, “And here’s the women who take a load on their face.” And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “God bless you, ladies.” [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the… Like that… I don’t know why, but I enjoy… I know it’s a lie. I know you’re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it’s such a, “Oh, jeez, I’m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there’s a good chance I’ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.” But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I’m like, “You fucking slut… Oh, I love you. Ah… Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um… Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh… All right, I’m going to get a towel. I’ll get a towel. I’ll get you a towel. All right. You’re a wonderful mother to our child.” [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See… this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I’m there wiping come off his mother’s face. I think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I’m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “Argh!” Like that. And I went… [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, “Hello, Hankie.” And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, “I love my daddy. Love, Hank.” But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the “K,” and… then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, “G’day, Hankie!” And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don’t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I’ve been telling everyone. And I can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He’s been training for this his entire life. I think I’ve, uh… I think I’ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, “Oh, I think like an American person now.” And I’m happy to do it. I just… I’ll tell you what happened. I was flying around… I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I’m so used to airports and stuff here in America that… Okay, what happens is, when you go… I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don’t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “Tickets, please.” And I’m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. ‘Cause I get through airports quick, man. I’m like, “Fucking there you go.” And she went, “Put your ID away. I don’t need to see that.” And I went… “I think you do.” And she went, “I don’t… Why would I need to see your ID?” And I said, “I might be a terrorist.” And she went, “Would showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?” “No, I’d probably still blow the plane up.” So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I’m so good at the airports. I’m already taking my shoes off as I’m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I’m American, and they’re losing their fucking shit. They’re like, “Oh, for fuck’s sake! One of these cunts, eh?” And the TSA guy goes, “Hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” And I went… [Shouting] “I don’t know! Maybe they’re bombs?” And he went… “But they’re not, are they?” I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone’s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “Jeez, mate. That’s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?” “It might also be a bomb.” And then the guy said the most Australian thing I’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. He went… “Oh, come on, mate. You wouldn’t have two bombs.” [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. All right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You’re fucking missing out, mate. If you don’t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine’s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been get',\n",
       "  'ting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone… He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine’s Day, right? Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running’s their second sport. You wouldn’t have thought that. Anyway… I’m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here’s the difference. Picture my accent, but I’m punching a black person. What I’m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So… she’s coming out of the shower. She’s been drying her hair. She’s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He’s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] “What the fuck is this? I’ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.” And she’s like, “Oh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?” “Who am I? I’m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That’s who the fuck I am.” “Well, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” – [Audience exclaiming] – I know. [Audience laughing] “Oh! Fuck you!” “No! Fuck you! I’m leaving you!” And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “You fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day… that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don’t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!” That’s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. “Oh, you’re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.” She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn’t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar’s one of the few men on Earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so… Boing! Ah! So… I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now… in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look… I’ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. I’ve never raped a man, but… if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. Like, “You want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?” There’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He’s the hero. All right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, – I thank you very much for coming. – [Audience groaning] No, I said, “soon,” not “over.” It’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always… I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I’m going to go, “Fucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.” [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don’t think I’ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don’t know if I’ll be invited this time. They’ll be like, [In South African accent] “We don’t like him. He’s no good.” Anyway, so, I’m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You’ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um… But it was all right ’cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn’t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice ’cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I’ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. So… I’m wearing a white T-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, “Hello,” and the lady goes, [In South African accent] “Oh, Mr. Jefferies, I’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” I said, “You what now?” She goes, “Business class is full. You have been downgraded.” And I said, “I understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.” And she went, “I’m sorry, sir. There’s nothing I can do.” And then I just went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” Now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” And she went, “Please do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!” And I said, “Are you, a white South African, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” Anyway… tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, r',\n",
       "  'ight? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] “What is wrong here? What is wrong?” And I said, “I bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.” And he goes, “What do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can’t do anything.” He goes, “I’ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, “There’s nothing I can do.” So I walk off with my ticket. I’m walking through the airport like, “Fucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, “Tickets, please.” And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] “I’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” And I said… [Inhales sharply] “I bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, “Next.” [Audience exclaiming] “Listen here, you fucking cunt.” [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, “Don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” And I said, “I want to speak to Simon Fulcher,” like I’m… And they go, “All right.” They ring the manager up, and then they go… He goes, “Is it the pale Australian man?” And the guy went, “Yes.” He goes, “We’ve had problems with him. Let him through.” Right? So I go through. I’m sitting there, I’m eating my peanuts. And I’m just angry now, going, “Fucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking…” Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all… And whenever I see Americans abroad… I’ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. You’re just walking around going, [In American accent] “Oh, this is great! Look at that. That’s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what’s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.” Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] “Did anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.” And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, “You can fuck off and all! You don’t know what I’ve been through! I’ve been downgraded!” And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “Fucking downgraded!” And the woman in the group was doing this, “Don’t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?” And all the men in the group were like, “Hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.” ♪ It doesn’t matter These people seem very angry, so ♪ And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] “Hey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.” And then I thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and I said, “Look, mate, don’t worry about it. It’s not like it’s your fault.” And I said, “Why are you in such a big group anyway?” And he goes, “Oh, we’re in Neil Diamond’s band. That’s Neil Diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and I reacted like he was one. I went, “Neil Diamond!” And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] “Hey, what’s going on?” And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, “Neil! Me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” And Neil went, “Oh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.” “You can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!” And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don’t know if you have the Internet, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. “Hey, what have you got there? Hiya!” Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let’s have a drink. Bye.

       " ['[rock music playing] [audience cheering] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Joe Rogan. [audience cheering and applauding] What the f*ck is going on, San Francisco? Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, f*ckface! I see you, b*tch! Put your phone down! Motherf*ckers. They can’t use their eyes. Everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I’m high as f*ck. Whoo. It’s strange. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I’m like, “Ugh…” It’s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is… I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people? I had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the f*ck are these people making these things, man? They’re not consistent. That’s also part of the problem. You don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it’s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. It’s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, “Hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” He goes… That’s not a unit of measurement. He’s like, “El diablo. El diablo.” “F*ck, man. How much should I take?” “Just the leg.” “Just the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, “Oh, shit.” They know. They know you’re not gonna die. You’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit. We learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins. [audience laughs] This is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. I’m like, “Um…” For like 20 minutes, I’m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. It’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but… I’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, “How smart are these f*cking things?” Because we’re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… I was thinking, “If people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” They wouldn’t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “I’m taking a chance.” And you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “F*ck! We lost Billy!” The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud. You don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That’s weird. They’re around fishing all the time and like, “B*tch.” They’re f*cking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. I don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. But we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. Right? They don’t send e-mails. They don’t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. You don’t need your fingers. No one’s typing. They have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. All the food’s free. They stay where the water’s warm. I started thinking, “How f*cking smart are they? What if they’re exactly the same as us? What if it’s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?” I was thinking, “What if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” The way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” I was like, “What if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? They’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin’s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.” And then I started thinking, “What if that’s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We’re just living life through different bodies. What if that’s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if it’s you livi',\n",
       "  'ng another life.” [audience cheering and applauding] I mean… And then I thought, “God damn, how good is this weed I’m getting in California? Whoo! I’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” The problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em. We live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. But it’s the weirdest time ever, too. We’re, like, that close to President Trump. [man 2] No. Boo! “No. Boo!” You boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! All those Bernie Sanders people, “Yo, Bernie’s the shit.” “Did you vote for him?” “Voting ain’t real, bro. It doesn’t even work, dude.” We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby’s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner’s a chick. We’re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense. Nobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. It’s a stupid job. It’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It’s dumb! It’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn’t make any sense. Being president is great if there’s like 50 people. If there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It’s nonsense. It’s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this f*cking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He’s like, “I’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” Trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That’s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We’re down to assholes! Where’s Elon Musk when you need him? Where’s the f*cking geniuses? Where’s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He’s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that. The White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “What are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, “You’re sexist.” No, it’s not sexist. Here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘Cause men can’t even do everything men can do. See? There’s no physical equality, folks. That’s why we have the Olympics. ‘Cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and I can’t do. One of those things is guarding the f*cking White House. I know I can’t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I’ve met Shaquille O’Neal and his dick is where my face is. That’s not equality. That’s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I’m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We’re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don’t think I should, either. It’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is. Well, I’m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They’re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the f*ck out of all of them. Okay? Listen… If they’re guarding the door, I’m getting in. I don’t mean to sound cocky. But I’m just real confident. I could f*ck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we’re different. We’re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I’m not proud of it. I just tell you what’s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I’ll f*ck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are f*cking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, “Whoa! Are we gonna do this? What the f*ck are you doing here?” I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. “Women can do everything men can do. This guy’s a piece of shit. We’re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don’t agree with!” “What the guy said was total bullshit. Total bullshit.” How’d that girl get that job? I’ll tell you how that girl got that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one’s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. If there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. That office is now just an audition to see whic',\n",
       "  'h guy gets to f*ck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “There’s gotta be a f*cking way. There’s gotta be a f*cking way!” You got this girl who’s like, “I could guard the front door.” “Oh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.” And over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “Debbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?” “No, I don’t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I’m vegan.” And they will just… They will wear patchouli. They will do what the f*ck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor f*cking Debbie at the front door… “Why am I alone?” [chuckles] The whole story is so bananas. And it’s one of my favorite stories. So I’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. ‘Cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. There’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, “The government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government’s watching us all the time.” They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn’t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an “X” where the White House is. They’re like, “You’re good to go.” They let him go! Two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don’t… That’s like a suicide run. That’s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, “What kind of security do you think they have at the White House?” “Oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” Nope. Turns out they don’t even have a dog. You just f*cking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That’s a guy who wants to die! He’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “F*ck the government! F*ck my ex-wife! And f*ck everybody! I’m gonna do this! F*ck you!” Just sprinting, “Oh, my God, I’m doing it! Oh, my God, I’m doing it!” Thinking, with every step, “This is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this…” And he gets to the front door. It’s unlocked! He opens it. There’s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He’s probably going, “Why am I alive?” He’s probably thinking… He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, “I wanted to die. I don’t want to go to f*cking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?” Then he was probably pissed. “Where are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles]\\nImagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, “Everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?” Obama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? “So, let me see what the people have to say.” He’d just go, “Obama is a…” [groans] “I’m none of those f*cking things.” Freakin’ out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, “Why the f*ck did I do this?” I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can’t quit once you’re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, “Good morning, Mr. President,” he was probably like, “Oh, no! What the f*ck did I do this for? I didn’t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can’t sleep. I’m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the f*ck is guarding me?” Looks out in the hallway. There’s a girl taking selfies. That’d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the White House. [laughs] You know I’m not making this up. You’ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. You just, like… Like there’s something wrong with your back. That’s a recognizable pose. When did that start? ‘Cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… She’s a f*cking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. “Oh, people like that. They like what I’m doing.” Combo. A two-hole combo attractor. It’s all over online! It gets',\n",
       "  ' you a lot of likes. I saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That’s it. She’s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There’s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she’s just a regular girl, man. I’m watching this, I’m like, “This is a different kind of person.” She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn’t have a job that they like. She doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. They’re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don’t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. There’s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. And she’s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… That’s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I’m not like those other assholes. I’m different. I care. I care about who she is. I’m a nice person. I’m a hero or something. [laughs] “I’m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.” Mmm. If we get to come. If men don’t get to come, we get real Sméagol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] “Mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.” Everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There’s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There’s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They’re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. Right? If it’s someone you love, your real friend… If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I’ll be like, “B*tch, where the f*ck are you going? You’re gonna go to Florida? We can’t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the f*ck are you moving to Florida, man?” But you might be able to deal with it. “We can just visit each other every now and then.” But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you’d be like, “Oh, really? Get in the f*cking car! Just get in the car, dude.” Take him out to Death Valley, “Look around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.” Jesus Christ! There’s places in America you can’t live, man. You don’t wanna live in Detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “Hey, dude. Seriously? You think there’s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars ’cause California’s almost out of water.” Then he’ll nod, like, “Yeah, b*tch.” We’re right next to the ocean. What the f*ck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world’s blue. It’s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don’t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning… “Too complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.” Oh, my God! You’re f*cking crazy. We’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We’re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, “Man, I gotta build a new house.” No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! We’re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you’re gonna have. It’s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, “They’re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” Here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren’t going. See, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f',\n",
       "  '*cking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… They talk German and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That’s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter.” Then they make another one. They shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who’s in? You’re gonna all come with me. We’re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it. I watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I’m Clear. I’m back! I’m back now. If you haven’t seen… [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, ’cause I have a neighbor who’s a Scientologist, and I don’t even think he’s gay. I don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. His house is… I mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. It’s like, “What does this crazy f*ck believe?” And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, “I don’t see any red flags. I think we’re good. I think this is legit as f*ck.” If Scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. It’s like it’s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, “B*tch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don’t have video of Joseph Smith. There’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the f*ck is going on with you people?” I watched it with my mom, and it was like… First of all, Scientology, they don’t pay taxes. That’s disturbing. They’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, “Everything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.” Well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out… I don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It’s created by one person. That person knows it’s bullshit. In a religion, that dude’s dead. So it’s a religion ’cause L. Ron Hubbard’s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “I can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “You made me go to Catholic school. The f*ck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.” Imagine if I talked to my mom like that. Oh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don’t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It’s too confusing. And I think we’re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. There’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here’s why. They don’t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here’s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It’s fantastic. If you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. But it’s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, “If you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.” They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn’t get mad. They didn’t get defensive. They didn’t kill anybody. That’s a good cult. They just said, “What do you wanna do?” “We got nine wives. Shut the f*ck up!” “Everybody just… Everybody, just chill. Just chill.” That’s a good religion. That’s a good cult. Some cults aren’t that good. They get f*cking testy. You know the one. We don’t have to say who. You know what I’m talking about. There’s that one that will kill you if you draw th',\n",
       "  'eir guy. “Come on, man. I can’t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?” “No loopholes!” “F*ckin’ relax, bro.” And this isn’t just theoretical. People have died ’cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. F*cking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you… When there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird. Because when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn’t see ’em in the LA Times. You couldn’t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “Oh. I don’t wanna get killed. I don’t wanna show the pictures.” It was weird, until… the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas… where they promptly held a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. I’m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I’ll wait. They had a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin’ in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? You ever go to Texas? That’s not Santa Monica, b*tch. That’s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They’re not supposed to be there. People didn’t evolve in Texas. It’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. “Y’all go ahead. We’re gonna hang back here. I’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. My wife’s got the biggest titties. I’mma try to f*ck a snake. I think it can be done.” They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike. And that’s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It’s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. ‘Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It’s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It’s f*cking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” And everybody’s worried about… It’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. “Oh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this f*cking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.” [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, “We stick together. We’re all in this together.” That’s how they are in Texas, too. They’re like, “Y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” They have a f*cking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They’re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It’s not even a state. It’s a republic. They were like, “Man, we ain’t so sure about this whole United States thing. We’re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.” They don’t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here’s how I know this. I’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I’m gonna repeat it because I know you’re like, “Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” No. There’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in Texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “It don’t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!” One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “Shit, I didn’t know we could get tigers.” And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, “I ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We’re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We’re gonna need some real warrior genes. We’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, “Chris Kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come. We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the child',\n",
       "  'ren. Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you f*ckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs] I have kids and I lie to them. I get high around ’em, too. People say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. They say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I’m not. I’m high. I call it “elevated.” It’s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “Who are you?” What do you think? What’s the worst thing that can happen if I’m a little high around my kid? They’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “Look out. Don’t go there.” That’s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I’m high, I’m like, “You know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “Yeah, I know it’s not a baby.” “Do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “Maybe.” “Okay. That’s cool. That’s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.” [kisses] It’s weird, man. It’s weird raising little people. There’s some things that I didn’t expect. One of the things I didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. You have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. You don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. But you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. So you got… You got a little bit of… You’re like, “Oh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?” And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they’re like, “Dad, what the f*ck?” You’re like, “Aw… Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.” Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I’m like, “When do we tell ’em?” This lady goes, “When they’re 11.” They’re gonna be f*cking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn’t believe me. I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m off by a year.” That’s not as funny, but it’s… I didn’t mean it. But it’s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They’re like, “I teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.” “Eh… when you see ’em.” But unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. They’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. That’s all she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about getting stuffed. She’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she’s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, “Yeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It’s that big. What the f*ck? Teacher’s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?” They play dumb. They play dumb! They’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. They’re little humans. They wanna run shit. “Who is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the f*ck is going on?” I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “How the f*ck?” “Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?” “No, honey, I’ve never met him.” “But you let him in the house?” And there’s this moment… It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You’re like, “Oh, shit.” I don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, “Yeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That’s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. You can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, “How do birds fly?” I go, “Birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? But it’s actually a bunch of gases. That’s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.” “Whoa!” “Yeah, nature is crazy.” “Yeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?” “Magic! Christmas magic! Now go ',\n",
       "  'to bed. I’m trying to f*ck your mom! Go to bed!” [audience laughing] Jokes, folks. Just jokes. Can’t talk like that. That’s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They’re little, tiny people. They’re adorable. They don’t know anything yet. You gotta teach ’em everything. You can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I f*cking do. I f*cking do.” The guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. And that’s what it’s like in school. My daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named Debbie. And every day it’s, “Debbie says…” Oh, f*cking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don’t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. And some of ’em are crazy. My daughter’s like, “Debbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?” [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don’t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don’t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “I don’t know.” I’m like, “Sweetie, I don’t know. I don’t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it’s not something you can measure. So it’s not something you can see. So we don’t know. But here’s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “Yeah.” “Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It’s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. Their kid is f*cked! And everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. There’s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I’m gonna shut this light out, and I’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. All right?” I don’t say these things. I don’t say any of these things! I was like, “I don’t know. Maybe Debbie’s right. Doesn’t make sense to me. How would that work?” “How would that work?” “It wouldn’t work, would it?” Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start f*cking each other. Is that what happens? Mom f*cks the kids, or the… Yeah, exactly. Debbie’s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth’s 10,000 years old. They’re Young Earth Christians. They’re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them… I’m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they’re sweet. They’re really nice people. I hug ’em every time I see ’em. They’re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “I have no use for this.” [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “This f*cking thing’s confusing.” They’re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I’m like, “How many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?” Uh! I looked it up. There’s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “How old’s the Earth?” Number one answer is, “Older than your mother’s pussy.” And then they hang up. Number two answer is, “F*ck you!” After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That’s Debbie’s f*cking parents. So out of the people that answer polls… Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that f*cking stupid. And that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. We’re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who… They’re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don’t. They’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful. But there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. That’s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the f*ck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, “You ain’t shit without your dad, pussy.” These are monsters. This is not a normal person’s response. Normal people don’t leave comments. What a n',\n",
       "  'ormal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don’t like it. That’s it. It ends right there. But what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown Posse is playing. They know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their Cheez Doodle fingers. And like, “An open letter to Jennifer Lopez… Let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] Ugh… Dear, Jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see…” Just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, “Let me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. Oh!” And you know who’s dumber than them? Me. ‘Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they’re stupid. I still get upset. F*ck! This is the world, folks. This is the world we’re living in. Are we happy? I’m not sure. Is this what we wanted? I don’t know. [woman] No! No. [woman] No! Are you sure? [woman] No! Why are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom? What’s happening? [woman 2] No! Are you White Panthers? What is this? [man] Life sucks! What are you saying? [man] Life can kind of suck sometimes. Life can kind of suck? Maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “Life can kind of suck.” It’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “Yeah, I’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” It doesn’t get any better than today, man. So stupid. “Make America great again.” It’s as good as it’s ever been. What the f*ck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It’s never been better. This is as good as it’s ever been. It’s just weird. It’s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, b*tch. Don’t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “I think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” You’re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I’m not unhappy. I’ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. But when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don’t think about it while it’s happening. It’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. And when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “Hmm…” They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They’ll just start poking at you. It’s what people do. It’s natural. It’s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you’re on Verizon, they’re like, “Dude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a f*cking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it’s at. Wake up! Join us!” When you’re with all girls, they just start… They constantly f*ck with my manhood. It’s like, I’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I’m like, “Why is this pink?” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” And my wife’s like, “I think they’re right.” I’m like, “Oh… I see what the f*ck is going on here. It’s mutiny!” They just chip, chip, chip away. It’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack… You can’t say shit. You can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “I still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I’ll deal with this eventually.” But you’re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin’. You don’t do anything about it. You’re like, “I gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.” And men don’t want to admit that. “Not me, bro. Not me, bro. I’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” What are you, a f*cking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit? No one’s honest. No one’s honest about how much we need other people. That’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, “Wow, what a rebel!” But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We’re f*cking weird. We are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we’re all in denial. “I’m kind of a loner.” Oh, shut the f*ck up. There’s no such thing. It’s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You’re like, “I’l',\n",
       "  'l do more of that.” You find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “I’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don’t like that feeling. Hmm.” That’s what we do. That’s what we do. It’s weird. We don’t want to admit it. But that’s who we all are. And I’m just telling you this because I’ve never been more of a b*tch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I’m in this position. This is how I’m riding out my days, just like this. “Okay, okay, okay, okay.” But I’m also telling you right now that I’m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That’s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here’s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own… Not really. This is what everybody’s take is. This is the take that you’re supposed to have. “He’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a f*ck? You should do whatever you wanna do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don’t care what you do. But… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. That’s all I’m saying. I don’t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who’s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘Cause right now, we lost a f*cking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect! We’re down Bruce Jenner. And I’ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don’t exactly like what I’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don’t see what I’m seeing? We are watching the plot of a f*cking Stephen King book play out! An American athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he’s beautiful. You tell me you don’t see what I’m seeing? You have to say… You have to say she’s beautiful. “She’s beautiful.” She’s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I’d be even more disgusting. “Beauty’s unusual.” There’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus f*cking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That’s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.” Ahhh! Bang! I can’t! The world’s gone f*cking bananas! “What you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. You’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “Bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] I can’t. I can’t be one of you. I was… I was born a man.” “Nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You’re free. Bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of Vanity Fair.” “Huh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you f*cking with me? Because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “It can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams… can be real through surgery. Sleep.” [audience cheering and applauding] Thank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great f*cking time with you savages! Let’s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys. Thank you very much!

       " [\"Armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit, the former “SNL” writer John Mulaney offers sly takes on marriage, his beef with babies and the time he met Bill Clinton All right, Petunia. Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.” You’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.” It’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around. I talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with y\",\n",
       "  'ou?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?” My wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.” I grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s just a little bit wrong, i',\n",
       "  \"sn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.” My wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.” I have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.” I loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We would have little conferences before we wa\",\n",
       "  'lked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!” I didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo. It’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were ',\n",
       "  'like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was. And there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.” Kids have it very good now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents w',\n",
       "  \"ill take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.” No, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.” My dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero. The weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy\",\n",
       "  '. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.” What are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy. I was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.” I temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web compan',\n",
       "  \"y. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy. That’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it. I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the na\",\n",
       "  'me, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS. That is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president. And I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton. My mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton. Now, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later? So, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!” I learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Fred',\n",
       "  'erick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!” Anyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service. We land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life. And I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992. Let’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.

       " ['Intro\\nFade the music out. Let’s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all. “The Old Lady And The Dog”\\nI live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom! “My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” An',\n",
       "  'd we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!” “The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah. “Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know',\n",
       "  ', food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was. “Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much',\n",
       "  '– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.” “Putting On Socks”\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks. “If You’re Older You’re Smarter”\\nI don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who wor',\n",
       "  'ks in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go. “Getting Older Makes My Life Better”\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared. “Everybody Has Their Time”\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.” “Dating Takes Courage”\\nIt’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally',\n",
       "  ' speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.” “First Date”\\nI always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there. “Tits”\\nGuys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s ',\n",
       "  'tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!” “Divorce”\\nI’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a goo',\n",
       "  'd father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad. “Videoing Your Kids”\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!” “Life Is A Good Deal”\\nDon’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it ending. “Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t kno',\n",
       "  'w. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man. “If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad t',\n",
       "  'hought. “Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.

       " ['Wow. Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part. The, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don’t give of',\n",
       "  'f a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just… This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.” I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.” This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” I was like, “Perfect.” It seeme',\n",
       "  'd so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good. So… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some kind. I’m not going down without a fight.',\n",
       "  '” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.” As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know wha',\n",
       "  't I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.” So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.” The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I g',\n",
       "  'o, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.” You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!” So we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also se',\n",
       "  'e, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.” So… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know ',\n",
       "  'if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.” So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.” At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roll',\n",
       "  'er suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, yo',\n",
       "  'u owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.

       " ['Hello. Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up. So… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes.\\xa0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go,\\xa0“Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? Th',\n",
       "  'e subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was\\xa0his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!” So, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified\\xa0as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d',\n",
       "  ' have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life\\xa0on Earth. You don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was\\xa0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\xa045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles\\xa0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s\\xa0a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.',\n",
       "  '” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\xa0I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.” I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know\\xa0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest t',\n",
       "  'o ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long.\\xa0Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit? So… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m\\xa0gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on\\xa0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do fin',\n",
       "  'd that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes,\\xa0but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist\\xa0yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t…\\xa0burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about ',\n",
       "  'eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me ',\n",
       "  '45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead? But… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got\\xa0after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks! So… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists f',\n",
       "  'ind rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context,\\xa0it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\xa0“Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go. That’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!” And there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother',\n",
       "  ', Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked\\xa0respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went,\\xa0“Fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went,\\xa0“Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night! Prolefeed.
